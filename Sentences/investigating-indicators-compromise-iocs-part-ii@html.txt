In our blog post \"Investigating with Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) - Part I ,\" we presented a scenario involving the \"Acme Widgets Co.,\" a company investigating an intrusion, and its incident responder, John.

John's next objective is to examine the system \"ACMWH-KIOSK\" for evidence of attacker activity.

Using the IOCs containing the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) he developed during the analysis of \"ACM-BOBBO,\" John identifies the following IOC hits: Table 1: IOC hit summary After reviewing IOC hits in Redlineâ„¢ , John performs Live Response and put together the following timeline of suspicious activity on \"ACMWH-KIOSK\".

Table 2:

Summary of significant artifacts John examines the timeline in order to surmise the following chain of activities: On October 15, 2013, at approximately 16:17:56 UTC, the attacker performed a type 3 network logon, described here , to \"ACMWH-KIOSK\" from \"ACM-BOBBO\" using the ACME domain service account, \"backupDaily.\" A few seconds later, the attacker copied two executables, \"acmCleanup.exe\" and \"msspcheck.exe,\" from \"ACM-BOBBO\" to \"C:$RECYCLE.BIN.\" By generating MD5 hashes of both files, John determines that \"acmCleanup.exe\" is identical to the similarly named file on \"ACM-BOBBO\", which means it won't require malware analysis.

Since the MD5 hash of \"msspcheck.exe\" was not previously identified, John sends binary to a malware analyst, whose analysis reveals that \"msspcheck.exe\" is a variant of the \"acmCleanup.exe\" malware.

About a minute later, at 16:19:02 UTC, the attacker executed the Sysinternals PsExec remote command execution utility, which ran for approximately three minutes.

During this time period, event logs recorded the start and stop of the \"WCE SERVICE\" service, which corresponds to the execution of the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE).

John can assume PsExec was used to execute WCE, which is reasonable given the timeline of events and artifacts present on the system.

About seven minutes, later the registry recorded the modification of a Run key associated with persistence for \"msspcheck.exe.\" Finally, at 16:48:11 UTC, the attacker logged off from \"ACMWH-KIOSK\".

John found no additional evidence of compromise.

Since the IOCs are living documents, John's next step is to update his IOCs with relevant findings from his investigation of the kiosk system.

John updates the \"acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR)\" IOC with information from the \"msspcheck.exe\" variant of the attacker's backdoor including: File metadata like filename and MD5.

A uniquely named process handle discovered by John's malware analyst.

A prefetch entry for the \"msspcheck.exe\" binary.

Registry artifacts associated with persistence of \"msspcheck.exe.\"

From there, John double-checks the uniqueness of the additional filename with some search engine queries.

He can confirm that \"msspcheck.exe\" is a unique filename and update his \"acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR)\" IOC.

By updating his existing IOC, John ensures that he will be able to identify evidence attributed to this specific variant of the backdoor.

Changes to the original IOC have been indicated in green.

The updated IOC can be seen below: Figure 1: Augmented IOC for acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR)

John needs additional information before he can start to act.

He knows two things about the attacker that might be able to help him out:

The attacker is using a domain service account to perform network logons.

The attacker has been using WCE to obtain credentials and the \"WCE SERVICE\" service appears in event logs.

John turns to his security event and incident management (SEIM) system, which aggregates logs from his domain controllers, enterprise antivirus and intrusion detection systems.

A search of type 3 network logons using the \"backupDaily\" domain account turns up 23 different systems accessed using that account.

John runs another query for the \"WCE SERVICE\" and sees that logs from 3 domain controllers contain that service event.

John needs to look for IOCs across all Acme machines in a short period of time.
