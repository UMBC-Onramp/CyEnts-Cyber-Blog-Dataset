Third-party libraries, especially ad libraries, are widely used in Android apps.

Unfortunately, many of them have security and privacy issues.

In this blog, we summarize our findings related to the insecure usage of JavaScript binding in ad libraries.

First, we describe a widespread security issue with using JavaScript binding ( addJavascriptInterface ) and loading WebView content over HTTP, which allows a network attacker to take control of the application by hijacking the HTTP traffic.

We call this the JavaScript-Binding-Over-HTTP (JS-Binding-Over-HTTP) vulnerability.

Our analysis shows that, currently, at least 47 percent of the top 40 ad libraries have this vulnerability in at least one of their versions that are in active use by popular apps on Google Play.

Second, we describe a new security issue with the JavaScript binding annotation, which we call JavaScript Sidedoor.

Starting with Android 4.2, Google introduced the @JavascriptInterface annotation to explicitly designate and limit which public methods in Java objects are accessible from JavaScript.

If an ad library uses @JavascriptInterface annotation to expose security-sensitive interfaces, and uses HTTP to load content in the WebView, then an attacker over the network could inject malicious content into the WebView to misuse the exposed interfaces through the JS binding annotation.

We call these exposed JS binding annotation interfaces JS sidedoors .

Our analysis shows that these security issues are widespread, have affected popular apps on Google Play accounting for literally billions of app downloads.

The parties we notified about these issues have been actively addressing them.

Security Issues with JavaScript Binding over HTTP Android uses the JavaScript binding method addJavascriptInterface to enable JavaScript code running inside a WebView to access the app’s Java methods.

However, it is widely known that this feature, if not used carefully, presents a potential security risk when running on Android 4.1 or below.

As noted by Google: “Use of this method in a WebView containing untrusted content could allow an attacker to manipulate the host application in unintended ways, executing Java code with the permissions of the host application.”

[ 1 ] In particular, if an app running on Android 4.1 or below uses the JavaScript binding method addJavascriptInterface and loads the content in the WebView over HTTP, then an attacker over the network could hijack the HTTP traffic, e.g., through WiFi or DNS hijacking, to inject malicious content into the WebView – and thus take control over the host application.

We call this the JavaScript-Binding-Over-HTTP (JS-Binding-Over-HTTP) vulnerability.

If an app containing such vulnerability has sensitive Android permissions such as access to the camera, then a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform sensitive tasks such as taking photos or record video in this case, over the Internet, without a user’s consent.

We have analyzed the top 40 third-party ad libraries (not including Google Ads) used by Android apps.

Among the apps with over 100,000 downloads each on Google Play, over 42 percent of the free apps currently contain at least one of these top ad libraries.

The total download count of such apps now exceeds 12.4 billion.

From our analysis, at least 47 percent of these top 40 ad libraries have at least one version of their code in active use by popular apps on Google Play, and contain the JS-Binding-Over-HTTP vulnerability.

As an example, InMobi versions 2.5.0 and above use the JavaScript binding method addJavascriptInterface and load content in the WebView using HTTP.

Security Issues with JavaScript Binding Annotation Starting with Android 4.2, Google introduced the @JavascriptInterface annotation to explicitly designate and limit which public Java methods in the app are accessible from JavaScript running inside a WebView.

However, note that the @JavascriptInterface annotation does not provide any protection for devices using Android 4.1 or below, which is still running on more than 80 percent of Android devices worldwide.

We discovered a new class of security issues, which we call JavaScript Sidedoor ( JS sidedoor ), in ad libraries.

If an ad library uses the @JavascriptInterface annotation to expose security-sensitive interfaces, and uses HTTP to load content in the WebView, then it is vulnerable to attacks where an attacker over the network (e.g., via WIFI or DNS hijacking) could inject malicious content into the WebView to misuse the interfaces exposed through the JS binding annotation.

We call these exposed JS binding annotation interfaces JS sidedoors .

For example, starting with version 3.6.2, InMobi added the @JavascriptInterface JS binding annotation.

The list of exposed methods through the JS binding annotation in InMobi includes: createCalendarEvent (version 3.7.0 and above) makeCall (version 3.6.2 and above) postToSocial (version 3.7.0 and above) sendMail

(version 3.6.2 and above) sendSMS (version 3.6.2 and above) takeCameraPicture

(version 3.7.0 and above)

getGalleryImage (version 3.7.0 and above) registerMicListener (version 3.7.0 and above) InMobi also provides JavaScript wrappers to these methods in the JavaScript code served from their ad servers, as shown in Appendix A. InMobi also loads content in the WebView using HTTP.

If an app has the Android permission CALL_PHONE, and is using InMobi versions 3.6.2 to 4.0.2, an attacker over the network (for example, using Wi-Fi or DNS hijacking) could abuse the makeCall annotation in the app to make phone calls on the device without a user’s consent – including to premium numbers.

In addition, without requiring special Android permissions in the host app, attackers over the network, via HTTP or DNS hijacking, could also misuse the aforementioned exposed methods to misguide the user to post to the user’s social network from the device ( postToSocial in version 3.7.0 and above), send email to any designated recipient with a pre-crafted title and email body ( sendMail in version 3.6.2 and above), send SMS to premium numbers ( sendSMS in version 3.6.2 and above), create calendar events on the device ( createCalendarEvent in version 3.7.0 and above), and to take pictures and access the photo gallery on the device ( takeCameraPicture and getGalleryImage in version 3.7.0 and above).

To complete these actions, the user would need to click on certain consent buttons.

However, as generally known, users are quite vulnerable to social engineering attacks through which attackers could trick users to give consent.

We have identified more than 3,000 apps on Google Play that contain versions 2.5.0 to 4.0.2 of InMobi – and which have over 100,000 downloads each as of December, 2013.

Currently, the total download count for these affected apps is greater than 3.7 billion .

We have informed both Google and InMobi of our findings, and they have been actively working to address them.

New InMobi Update after FireEye Notification After we notified the InMobi vendor about these security issues, they promptly released new SDK versions 4.0.3 and 4.0.4.

The 4.0.3 SDK, marked as “Internal release”, was superseded by 4.0.4 after one day.

The 4.0.4 SDK made the following changes:

Changed its method exposed through annotation for making phone calls ( makeCall ) to require user’s consent.

Added a new storePicture interface to download and save specified files from the Internet to the user’s Downloads folder.

Despite the name, it can be used for any file, not just images.

Compared with InMobi’s earlier versions, we consider change No. 1 as an improvement that addresses the aforementioned issue of an attacker making phone calls without a user’s consent.

We are glad to see that InMobi made this change after our notification.

InMobi recently released a new SDK version 4.1.0.

Compared with SDK version 4.0.4, we haven't seen any changes to JS Binding usage from a security perspective in this new SDK version 4.1.0.

Moving Forward:

Improving Security for JS Binding in Third-party Libraries In summary, the insecure usage of JS Binding and JS Binding annotations in third-party libraries exposes many apps that contain these libraries to security risks.

App developers and third-party library vendors often focus on new features and rich functionalities.

However, this needs to be balanced with a consideration for security and privacy risks.

We propose the following to the mobile application development and library vendor community: Third-party library vendors need to explicitly disclose security-sensitive features in their privacy policies and/or their app developer SDK guides.

Third-party library vendors need to educate the app developers with information, knowledge, and best practices regarding security and privacy when leveraging their SDK.

App developers need to use caution when leveraging third-party libraries, apply best practices on security and privacy, and in particular, avoid misusing vulnerable APIs or packages.

When third-party libraries use JS Binding, we recommend using HTTPS for loading content.

Since customers may have different requirements regarding security and privacy, apps with JS-Binding-Over-HTTP vulnerabilities and JS sidedoors can introduce risks to security-sensitive environments such as enterprise networks.

FireEye Mobile Threat Prevention provides protection to our customers from these kinds of security threats.
