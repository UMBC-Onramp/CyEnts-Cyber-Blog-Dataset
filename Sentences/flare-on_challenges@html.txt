It’s not an alien space ship, it’s a huge belt buckle for this year’s\nwinners (quarter for scale)!

The challenge was a massive success, with\n162 winners from a total of 1408 active participants.

We consider\nactive participants as those who solved one or more challenges.

All\nthe stats presented here are as of 12:00pm Eastern Time, which is 8\nhours before the end of the contest.

The first challenge binary was\ndownloaded by 4,850 people.

The following graph depicts the number of\nfinishers of each of the 11 stages this year.

The first few challenges narrowed the playing field drastically, with most serious contestants holding firm through challenges 4-9.

The last two increased the difficulty level and proved a difficult final series of challenges for a well-earned finish line.

The FLARE On Challenge always reaches a very wide international audience.

Outside of the USA, this year’s country with the most finishers was China, with and impressive 11 winners.

I hope that massive shipment of belt buckles doesn’t get caught up in customs!

The performance of contestants from Vietnam and Slovakia were also particularly commendable, as both held early leads in total finishers.

Based on the locations we are sending the challenge prizes to (people who responded with their shipping info by noon today) we can say that 33 countries had finishers this year.

This next graphs shows the total winners by country this year.

And without further ado, here are the solutions for this year’s challenges, each written by their respective challenge creator.
