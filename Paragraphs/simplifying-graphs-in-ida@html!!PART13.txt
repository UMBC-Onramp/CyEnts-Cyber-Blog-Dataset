This has the effect of hiding all graph nodes that you aren’t currently examining and allows you to better focus on analysis of the current group.
As you can see, we’re abusing group creation a bit so that we can avoid creating a custom graph viewer, and instead stay within the built-in IDA graph disassembly view which allows us to continue to markup the disassembly as you’re used to.
Complementing the graph gives you the view seen in Figure 10, where the entire graph is grouped into a node named “Complement of group X”.
