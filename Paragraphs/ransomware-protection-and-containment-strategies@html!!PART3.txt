In our latest report, Ransomware Protection and Containment Strategies: Practical Guidance for Endpoint Protection, Hardening, and Containment , we discuss steps organizations can proactively take to harden their environment to prevent the downstream impact of a ransomware event.
These recommendations can also help organizations with prioritizing the most important steps required to contain and minimize the impact of a ransomware event after it occurs.
Ransomware is commonly deployed across an environment in two ways: Manual propagation by a threat actor after they’ve penetrated an environment and have administrator-level privileges broadly across the environment: Manually run encryptors on targeted systems.
Deploy encryptors across the environment using Windows batch files (mount C$ shares, copy the encryptor, and execute it with the Microsoft PsExec tool).
Deploy encryptors with Microsoft Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
Deploy encryptors with existing software deployment tools utilized by the victim organization.
Automated propagation: Credential or Windows token extraction from disk or memory.
Trust relationships between systems – and leveraging methods such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), SMB, or PsExec to bind to systems and execute payloads.
Unpatched exploitation methods (e.g., EternalBlue – addressed via Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010 ).
