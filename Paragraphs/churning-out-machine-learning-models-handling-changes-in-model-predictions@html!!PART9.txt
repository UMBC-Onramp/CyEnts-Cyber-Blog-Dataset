We’ll refer to this model as the standard retrain.
This is a reasonably realistic simulation of actual production data collection and model retraining.
Finally, both the baseline model and the standard retrain are evaluated on test 2.
The standard retrain has a higher accuracy than the baseline on test 2, 99.33% vs 99.10% respectively.
However, there are 246 misclassifications made by the retrain model that were not made by the baseline or 0.12% bad churn.
Incremental Learning Since our rationale for retraining is that cyber security threats change over time, e.g. concept drift, it’s a natural suggestion to use techniques like incremental learning to handle retraining.
In incremental learning we take new data to learn new concepts without forgetting (all) previously learned concepts.
That also suggests that an incrementally trained model may not have as much churn, as the concepts learned in the baseline model still exist in the new model.
Not all ML models support incremental learning, but linear and logistic regression, neural networks, and some decision trees do.
