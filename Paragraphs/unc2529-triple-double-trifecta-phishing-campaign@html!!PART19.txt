The persistence mechanism, the bootstrap, and the launcher are described in more details in the following sections.
Persistence Mechanism The persistence mechanism implemented by the DOUBLEDROP sample is slightly different depending on whether the dropper has been started within an elevated PowerShell process or not.
If the dropper was executed within an elevated PowerShell process, it creates a scheduled task with an action specified as TASK_ACTION_COM_HANDLER and the class ID - the {<rnd_guid_2>} GUID (See Figure 5).
Once executed by the system, the task finds the {<rnd_guid_2>} class under the HKLM\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID registry path, which in this case points to an emulator class via the TreatAs registry key.
