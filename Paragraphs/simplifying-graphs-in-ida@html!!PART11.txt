As you create groups, rows in the chooser turn red indicating a group already exists, or can't be created because there is an overlap with an existing group.
Another note: this calculation does not currently work on functions that do not return (those with an infinite loop).
See the Appendix for details.
Graph Complement Creating groups to simplify the overall control flow graph is nice, but it doesnâ€™t help understand the details of a group that you create.
