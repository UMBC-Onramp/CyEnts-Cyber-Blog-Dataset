If it is not the right hash, the malware gets the next API name and continues its calculations.
The ransomware repeats this same process until it resolves the API addresses that the malware needs.
This is quite a simple trick.
Most malware hides its APIs and resolves the right addresses using different combinations of LoadLibraryA, GetProcAddress, and other APIs.
They also use different combinations of encryption, calculations, and encodings.
But at the end of the malwareâ€™s API addresses resolving algorithm we still get the list of APIs with their proper addresses.
