If someone were to unplug the monitor of a stable patient and replace it with a device that continued to report the same stable vitals, would that cause any harm?
Probably not immediately.
But what if the stable patient suddenly became unstable?
The central station would normally sound an alarm to alert medical personal, who could take appropriate action.
However, if the monitor had been replaced, would anyone know help was needed?
The patient monitor also normally sounds alarms that might be heard in and outside of the patientâ€™s room, yet if the monitor was replaced, those alarms would be absent.
