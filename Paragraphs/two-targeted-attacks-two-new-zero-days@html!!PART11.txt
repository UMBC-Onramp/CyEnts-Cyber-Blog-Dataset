The tool appears to have gone through at least three iterations over time.
The initial tool and exploits is believed to have had limited availability, and may have been employed by a handful of distinct attack groups.
As the exploited vulnerability was remediated, someone with access to the tool modified it to use a newer exploit when one became available.
These two newer versions likely did not achieve the widespread distribution that the original tool/exploits did and may have been retained privately, not necessarily even by the same actors.
