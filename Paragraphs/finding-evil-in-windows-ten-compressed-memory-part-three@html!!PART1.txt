This is the final post in the three-part series: Finding Evil in Windows 10 Compressed Memory .
In the first post ( Volatility and Rekall Tools ), the FLARE team introduced updates to both memory forensic toolkits.
These updates enabled these open source tools to analyze previously inaccessible compressed data in memory.
This research was shared with the community at the 2019 SANS
DFIR Austin conference and is available on GitHub ( Volatility and Rekall ).
In the second post ( Virtual Store Deep Dive ), we looked at the structures and algorithms involved in locating and extracting compressed pages from the Store Manager.
