The external memory is called an EEPROM and is easily identifiable on the board, first by its shape and then by the label printed on it.
Labels on electronic components are used to identify them and to retrieve their associated datasheet, the technical documentation describing how to use the chip from an electrical engineering standpoint.
Soldering wires directly to the chip under a microscope, and connecting it to a programmer (a $30 gizmo called a buspirate ), allows us to change the configuration stored on it and enable the debug capabilities of the phone.
