The bank can freeze your card, change your passwords, and advise you about further steps.
We’ll close with a few FAQs to clear up any lingering questions.
Should I respond to fraudulent messages, just to have them remove me from their mailing list?
Do not do that.
Responding simply confirms that your phone number is active.

What if it’s not smishing but an important message from my bank?
If you have any doubts, contact your bank directly.
