In this article we took a quick look at the differences between the libemu and Unicorn emulators API.
This allowed us to create a shim layer to import legacy libemu code and use it with Unicorn largely unchanged.
Once the shim layer was in place, we next imported the libemu Win32 Environment so we could run it under Unicorn.
As a final test we ported several large portions of the scdbg project, which was originally written to run under libemu.
Here our previous work allowed for the importation of scdbg's 250+ API hooks and debug shell to run under Unicorn with only minimal changes.
Overall the entire process went quite smoothly and should provide benefits for developers of libemu and/or Unicorn.
