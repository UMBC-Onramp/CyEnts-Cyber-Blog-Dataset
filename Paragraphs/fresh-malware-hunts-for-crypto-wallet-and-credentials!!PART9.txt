Real Malware Runs Inside the Second Process
According to my analysis, the decrypted PE file running inside the second process is written in MS Visual Basic 5.0-6.0 language without any packer.
I dumped it into a local file, and Figure 3.1 shows the detection result in an analysis tool—Exeinfo PE.
When it starts, it first gathers basic information about the victim’s device, such as current System Time, Windows Version, User Name, Computer Name, and so on.
