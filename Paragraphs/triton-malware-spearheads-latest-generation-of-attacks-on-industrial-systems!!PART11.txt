Fighting ICS malware ICS malware has become more aggressive and sophisticated.
Many industrial devices were built before anyone imagined cyberattacks such as Triton.
ICSâ€™s are now exposed to connected environments they were not designed for.
Standard McAfee security recommendations (vulnerability patching, complex passwords, identification control, security tools, etc.) remain the same as for regular networks, yet industrial systems also require specific procedures due to their importance.
Industrial networks must be segregated from general business networks, and every machine connected to the industrial process should be carefully monitored by using strict access control and application whitelisting.
Further security recommendations: Segregate physical and logical access to ICS networks with strong authentication, including strong passwords and double factor, card readers, surveillance cameras, etc.
Use DMZ and firewall to prevent network traffic from passing between the corporate and the ICS network Deploy strong security measures on the ICS network perimeter, including patch management, disabling unused ports, and restricting ICS user privileges Log and monitor every action on the ICS network to quickly identify a point of failure When possible implement redundancy on critical devices to avoid major issues Develop strong security policies and an incident response plan to restore systems during an incident Train people with simulated incident responses and security awareness Attackers learn what works from past attacks and from each other.
