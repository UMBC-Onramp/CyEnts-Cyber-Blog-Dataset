The sample starts by setting an alarm that kills the application after a configurable number of minutes, 14 by default.
It then enters a loop which reads /proc/
entries every 2 seconds looking for a target application, this interval is also configurable.
The target is found by opening /proc/<process_name>/cmdline for each entry in the folder and then reading this file looking for the string dswsd within the command line.
Once found the target application's proc/<target_pid>/mem is opened, the process is attached to with PTRACE, then memory read in chunks up to 512 bytes in size.
For each chunk, the string 20 30 20 0A 00 ( 0 \\n) is searched for as a needle.
If found the sample splits the data by first space, then a dash -.
Two dashes are expected to be found, and these are immediately converted into hex numbers, example form: -<number
