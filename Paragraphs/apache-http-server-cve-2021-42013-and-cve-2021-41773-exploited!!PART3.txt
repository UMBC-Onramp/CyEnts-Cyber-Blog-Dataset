It was observed that the patch rolled out for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache http server 2.4.50 was insufficient.
The attackers could map the URLs to files outside the directories that can be configured by alias-like directives.
If these files and directories are not protected by the default configuration “ require all denied” , it could lead to code execution.
Inside Alias.conf Apache http server version 2.4.51 was released to mitigate these flaws.
These vulnerabilities affect only Apache web servers running on version 2.4.49 and 2.4.50.
