At this point, we can see that these variants of SimpleLocker and SlemBunk share four out of five major components and share the same supporting utilities.
The only difference is in the final payload, with SlemBunk phishing for banking credentials while SimpleLocker encrypts certain files and demands ransom.
This leads us to believe that SimpleLocker came from the same original code base as SlemBunk.
Conclusion Our analysis confirms that several Android malware families share a common origin, and that the first known file-encrypting ransomware for Android – SimpleLocker – is based on the same code as several banking trojans.
