Due to its increased popularity and profitability cybercriminals have been targeting all things blockchain.
McAfee Advanced Threat Research team analysts have now published the McAfee Blockchain Threat Report to explain current threats against the users and implementers of blockchain technologies.
What is Blockchain?
Even if you have not heard of blockchain, you have likely heard of cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, the most popular implementation.
In late 2017 Bitcoin reached a value of $20,000 per coin, prompting a lot of interest in the currency—including from cybercriminals.
Cryptocurrencies are built on top of blockchain, which records transactions in a decentralized way and enables a trusted “ledger” between trustless participants.
Each block in the ledger is linked to the next block, creating a chain.
Hence, the system is called a blockchain.
