We also have to acknowledge the research performed by the TRITON attackers.
We borrowed a lot of your knowledge about TriStation from the TRITON framework itself.
Finally, remember that we're here to collaborate.
We think most of our research is right, but if you notice any errors or omissions, or have ideas for improvements, please spear phish contact: smiller@fireeye.com.
