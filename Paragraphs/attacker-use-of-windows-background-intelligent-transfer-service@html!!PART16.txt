A full understanding of the persistence mechanism would allow Mandiant to hunt for additional evidence of attacker activity across the environment and in other engagements.
As focus intensified, Mandiant consultants identified evidence to indicate that the BITS service launched the KEGTAP backdoor.
Analysts identified entries in the Microsoft-Windows-Bits-Client operational event log which associated the BITS service activity with the file mail.exe .

Figure 3: Event log entries showing the creation of a BITS job for persistence Mandiant consultants were able to confirm the details of the BITS job by interacting with the host and examining the QMGR database.
The malicious BITS job was set to attempt an HTTP transfer of a nonexistent file from the local host.
As this file would never exist, BITS would trigger the error state and launch the notify command, which in this case was KEGTAP.
