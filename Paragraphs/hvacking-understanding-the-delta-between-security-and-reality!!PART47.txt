The large malformed packet contains “where” we want to “write” to and puts our shellcode into memory yet does not contain “what” we want to write.
The “what”, in this case, is the address of our shellcode, so our last packet needs to contain this address.
The final challenge is deciding where in the last packet the address belongs.
Recall from the core dump shown previously that the crash happens on memcpy attempting to write the value 0x81 to the bad address.
