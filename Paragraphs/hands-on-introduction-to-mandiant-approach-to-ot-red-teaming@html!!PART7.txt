Red Teaming in OT Provides Unique Value to Defenders Red teaming in OT can be uniquely helpful for defenders, as it generates value in a way very specific to an organizations' needs, while decreasing the gap between the \"no holds barred\" world of real attackers and the \"safety first\" responsibility of the red team.
While it is common for traditional red teaming engagements to end shortly after the attacker pivots into a production OT segment, a hybrid approach, such as the one we use, makes it possible for defenders to gain visibility into the specific strengths and weaknesses of their OT networks and security implementations.
Here are some other benefits of red teaming in OT production networks: It helps defenders understand and foresee possible paths that sophisticated actors may follow to reach specific goals.
While cyber threat intelligence is another great way to build this knowledge, red teaming allows for additional acquisition of site-specific data.
