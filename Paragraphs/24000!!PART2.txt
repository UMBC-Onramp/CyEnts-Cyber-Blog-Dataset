CVE-2022-1096 vulnerability So far Google has not published details about any of the vulnerabilities — as per the company’s security policy, access to a detailed description of the bugs remains restricted until the majority of active users update their browser.
But it is already clear that it is the CVE-2022-1096 vulnerability (the one that Google closed with a separate patch on Friday, March 25, just four days before the major update) that may cause real problems.
CVE-2022-1096 belongs to the Type Confusion class, that means it is connected to some error in data types handling in the V8 engine.
The vulnerability is pretty dangerous, judging by the fact that Google addressed this bug separately with an emergency patch.
What’s more, according to the patch release notes, Google was aware that an exploit for this vulnerability already existed on March 25.
