Consider the SolarWinds attack in February.
Threat actors managed to infiltrate a software update package with malicious code.
They then pushed it out to more than 18,000 businesses, along with government agencies such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of the Treasury.
The most frightening part of this third-party problem?
Trust.
Companies remain vigilant for ransomware attacks on their networks.
Meanwhile, trusted third-party providers often get a free pass into corporate systems because they’ve never been the source of problems in the past.
The result is an infosec complacency that can lead to serious security risk.
On average, it now takes 280 days for companies to detect security risks, even when they’re actively looking.
The solution starts with zero trust security .
By setting up protective frameworks that use authentication rather than assumption, enterprises can reduce the risk of third-party compromise.
It’s worth taking the time to look at all third-party interactions, even those deemed safe in the past.
