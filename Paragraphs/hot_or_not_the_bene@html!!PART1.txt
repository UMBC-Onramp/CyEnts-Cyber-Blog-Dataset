Introduction Apple has made a significant effort to build and maintain a healthy and clean app ecosystem.
The essential contributing component to this status quo is the App Store, which is protected by a thorough vetting process that scrutinizes all submitted applications.
While the process is intended to protect iOS users and ensure apps meet Appleâ€™s standards for security and integrity, developers who have experienced the process would agree that it can be difficult and time consuming.
The same process then must be followed when publishing a new release or issuing a patched version of an existing app, which can be extremely frustrating when a developer wants to patch a severe bug or security vulnerability impacting existing app users.
