A special thank you goes out to Zynamics for their MSDN crawler and the IDA importer which greatly supported our development.
Our plug-in has mainly been tested on IDA Pro for Windows, though it should work on all platforms.
Due to the structure of the MSDN documentation and limitations of the MSDN crawler, not all constants can be parsed automatically.
When you encounter missing information you can extend the annotation database by placing files with supplemental information into the MSDN_data directory.
In order to be processed correctly, they have to be valid XML following the schema given in the main database file (msdn_data.xml).
