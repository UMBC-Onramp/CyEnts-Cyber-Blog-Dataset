With the combination of protocol and SSL detection, each independent of the other, FakeNet-NG can now handle just about any protocol combination.
The proxied SSL implementation also allows for improved packet analysis.
The connection between the proxy and the Listener is not encrypted, which allows FakeNet to dump un-encrypted packets to the pcap output.
This makes it easier for the analyst to examine the packet data.
FakeNet continues to produce pcap output that includes packet data before and after modification by FakeNet.
