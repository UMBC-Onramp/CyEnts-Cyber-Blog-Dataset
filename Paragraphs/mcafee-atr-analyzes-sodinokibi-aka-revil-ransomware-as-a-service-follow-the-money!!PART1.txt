This is the third installment of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) analysis of Sodinokibi and its connections to GandCrab, the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Campaign of 2018 and mid 2019.
The Talking Heads once sang “We’re on a road to nowhere.”
This expresses how challenging it can be when one investigates the financial trails behind a RaaS scheme with many affiliates, etc.
However, we persisted, and we prevailed.
By linking underground forum posts with bitcoin transfer traces, we were able to uncover new information on the size of the campaign and associated revenue; even getting detailed insights into what the affiliates do with their earnings following a successful attack.
With the Sodinokibi ransomware a unique BTC wallet is generated for each victim.
As long as no payment is made, no trace of the BTC wallet will be available on the blockchain.
