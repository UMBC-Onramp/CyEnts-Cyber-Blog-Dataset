Specifically, we link a CVE to a tweet if it contains a CVE number in the message body, or if the URL content contains a CVE.
Each tweet must be associated with a single CVE and must be classified as relevant to security-related topics to be scored.
The first forecasting task considers how well our model can predict the CVSS rankings ahead of time.
The second task is predicting future exploitation of the vulnerability for a CVE based on Symantec Antivirus Signatures and Exploit DB.
