The second DLL employs a few additional antidebugging techniques.
One is the use of a custom exception handler and code paths that are designed to generate exceptions.
There are also a few random empty-nested threads to slow down researchers during static analysis.
The final antidebugging technique involves GetTickCount performance counters, which are placed within the main sections of code to detect any delay a debugger adds during runtime.
