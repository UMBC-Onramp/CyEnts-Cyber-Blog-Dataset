As Message Trace results are reviewed, attention should be given to IP addresses to determine which emails were sent by attackers.
If phishing was the suspected initial compromise vector, it’s a good idea to also query for incoming mail received within a few days prior to the first compromise date and look for suspicious sender addresses and/or subject lines.
