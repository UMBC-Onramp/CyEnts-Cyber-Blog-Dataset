It’s up to us to shape how the world will look like for us in 10 years, for our children and our children’s children.
You, the people have the power — the power to create machines.
The power to create happiness!
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.
Then — in the name of democracy — let us use that power — let us all unite.
Let us fight for a new world — a decent world that will give men a chance to work — that will give youth a future and old age a security.
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power.
But they lie!
They do not fulfil that promise.
They never will!
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people!
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!
Let us fight to free the world — to do away with national barriers — to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness.
Soldiers!
in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
Final speech from The Great Dictator
