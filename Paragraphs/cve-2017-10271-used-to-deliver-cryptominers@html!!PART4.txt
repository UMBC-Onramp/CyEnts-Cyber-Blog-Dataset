Figure 1: Downloading the payload directly Tactic #2: Utilizing PowerShell scripts to deliver the miner Other tactics involve the exploit delivering a PowerShell script, instead of downloading the executable directly (Figure 2).
Figure 2:
Exploit delivering PowerShell script This script has the following functionalities: Downloading miners from remote servers Figure 3: Downloading cryptominers As shown in Figure 3, the .ps1 script tries to download the payload from the remote server to a vulnerable server.
Creating scheduled tasks for persistence Figure 4:
Creation of scheduled task Deleting scheduled tasks of other known cryptominers Figure 5: Deletion of scheduled tasks related to other miners In Figure 4, the cryptominer creates a scheduled task with name “ Update service for Oracle products1 ”.
  
In Figure 5, a different variant deletes this task and other similar tasks after creating its own, “ Update service for Oracle productsa ”.
From this, it’s quite clear that different attackers are fighting over the resources available in the system.
Killing processes matching certain strings associated with other cryptominers Figure 6: Terminating processes directly Figure 7:
Terminating processes matching certain strings Similar to scheduled tasks deletion, certain known mining processes are also terminated (Figure 6 and Figure 7).
