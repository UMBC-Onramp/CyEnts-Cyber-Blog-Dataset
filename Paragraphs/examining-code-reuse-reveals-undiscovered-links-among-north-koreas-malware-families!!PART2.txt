Valuable context This article is too short to dig deeply into the history, politics, and economic changes of recent years.
Nonetheless, we must highlight some events to put past and present cyber events into perspective.
The DPRK, like any country, wants to be as self-sufficient and independent as possible.
However, for products such as oil, food, and foreign currency for trading, the country lacks resources and has to find ways of acquiring them.
What can a nation do when legal international economics are denied?
To survive, it must gain foreign currency for trading.
One of the oldest ways to do this is to join the worlds of gambling (casinos) and drugs.
In 2005, the United States wanted to shut down North Korean enterprises involved in illegal operations.
They investigated a couple of banks in Asia that seemed to have ties with North Korea and operated as money laundering sites.
One bank in particular is controlled by a billionaire gambling mogul who started a casino in Pyongyang and has close ties to Pyongyang.
That bank, based in Macau, came back into the picture during an attack on the SWIFT financial system of a bank in Vietnam in 2015.
