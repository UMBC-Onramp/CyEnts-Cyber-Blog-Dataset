So, in recognition of over 50 years since the first computer virus was discovered, we have decided to provide a brief historical insight into the history of computer malware from the pre-internet era to the current world of botnets, ransomware, viruses, worms, and more.
To start, here is some basic terminology: A virus cannot replicate without human interaction, whether clicking a link, opening an attachment, launching an application, or downloading a file.
A worm does not require human interaction and can replicate on its own, tunnel deep into systems, and move between devices.
Malware is a generic term that encapsulates all threats—viruses, worms, botnets, ransomware , etc.—anything malicious that is software-related.
It would be impossible to cover all malware and events over the past 50 years in such a short blog post.
Instead, we’ve highlighted many of the most notable examples and memorable events of the past 50 years.
