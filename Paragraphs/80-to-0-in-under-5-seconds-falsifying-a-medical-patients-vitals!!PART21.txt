Plus, because the real patient monitor is still online, it will constantly send data to the central monitoring station.
One way to account for these factors is to use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing.
If the patient monitor is ARP spoofed, then the attacker, instead of the central monitoring station, would receive the data packets.
This step would allow the attacker to determine which ports are in use and stop the patient monitorâ€™s data from getting to the central monitoring station.
