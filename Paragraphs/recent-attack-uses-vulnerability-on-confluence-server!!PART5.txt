The command for dos attack or controlling their victims can be seen in following rawdata:
Fileless Attack The observed packet is from 141.98.83.139 (AS 209588 Flyservers S.A.) and the main payload is b64 encoded.
The decoded data is as follow: We can see that the payload is constructed and executed via PowerShell.
The final execution will set “WindowStyle” to hidden and “CreateNoWindow” to True, which is to put itself out of sight.
We decoded those data in the middle and replace {0} and {1} with “=” and “P”, then 2nd layer payload data It defined two functions, and one variable that contain the main exploit code.
After converting the code in $sG, it will use VirtualAlloc to reserve a part of memory.
Then it uses CreateThread to invoke the malicious code.
So what exactly $sG is?
After b64 decoding, we get about 570 bytes binary data as below: To dive deep in to this, we have to check this binary by IDA.
