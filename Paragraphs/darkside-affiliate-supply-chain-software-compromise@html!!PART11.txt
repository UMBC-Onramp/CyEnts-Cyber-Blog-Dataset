The dropper uses the Add-Type cmdlet to define a new .NET class for the backdoor.
The Add-Type cmdlet can be used to define a new .NET class using an existing assembly or source code files or specifying source code inline or saved in a variable.
In this case, the dropper uses SMOKEDHAM backdoor source code that is stored in a variable.
The SMOKEDHAM backdoor source code is embedded as an encrypted string.
The dropper uses the ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet and an embedded key to decrypt the source code prior to executing the Add-Type cmdlet.
After defining a new .NET class for the backdoor, the dropper executes the backdoor's entry point.
The dropper configures the backdoor with a C2 server address, RC4 encryption key, and sleep interval.
