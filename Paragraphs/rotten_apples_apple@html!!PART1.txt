At FireEye Labs we have an automated system designed to proactively detect newly registered malicious domains.
This system observed some phishing domains registered in the first quarter of 2016 that were designed to appear as legitimate Apple domains.
These phony Apple domains were involved in phishing attacks against Apple iCloud users in China and UK.
In the past we have observed several phishing domains targeting Apple, Google and Yahoo users; however, these campaigns are unique as they are serving the same malicious phishing content from different domains to target Apple users.
Since January 2016 we have observed several phishing campaigns targeting the Apple IDs and passwords of Apple users.
