How to protect yourself The scheme is big enough for the implicated companies to draw attention to it.
ArtStation, for its part, posted an in-depth article about the scam.
Some game developers and publishers have also posted warnings on their websites for potential candidates.
Some studios warn artists to be careful Here are some tips to help you avoid falling victim to this kind of scam: Limit job searches to official sources.
ArtStation’s job board , for example, shows only vetted listings.
Be wary of offers to discuss a job or hold an interview in secret chats, in which messages are encrypted and cannot be forwarded, and which alert participants if anyone takes a screenshot.
Check contact information on companies’ official websites, which usually provide addresses and communication channels for HR personnel.
If necessary, e-mail a general inquiry to the company asking if the person who contacted you actually works there.
Use a reliable security solution with fraud and phishing protection.
