With our without mods and addons, Cities: Skylines allows you to build your own city.
Divide the land between housing, industry, and commerce.
Plan roads and fight traffic jams.
The game is so good and so realistic that people even used it to plan the transportation system of a real city!
An example of a good mod for Cities: Skylines is Traffic Manager: President Edition .
It adds fine-tuning to the gameâ€™s basic road construction features: you can fine-tune traffic lights, set lane direction and speed limits, prohibit parking, and so on.
Basically, the mod enables you to do things that are essential for traffic improvement, both in real life and in the game.
To summarize, you can play Cities: Skylines without extensions, but few fans do it, because a properly chosen set of mods both seriously improves game play and makes it more convenient.
