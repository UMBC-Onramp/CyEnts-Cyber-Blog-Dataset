The right side of Table 1 shows the result of executing our plug-in showing the support it offers to an analyst.
The most obvious change is that constants are renamed automatically.
In this example, 40000000h was automatically converted to GENERIC_WRITE.
Additionally, each function argument is renamed to a unique name, so the corresponding description can be added to the disassembly.
Table 1: Automatic labelling of standard symbolic constants In Figure 1 you can see how the plug-in enables you to display function, argument, and constant information right within the disassembly.
The top image shows how hovering over the CreateFileA function displays a short description and the return value.
In the middle image, hovering over the hTemplateFile argument displays the corresponding description.
And in the bottom image, you can see how hovering over dwShareMode, the automatically renamed constant displays descriptive information.
Functions Arguments Constants Figure 1:
Hovering function names, arguments and constants displays the respective descriptions How it works Before the plug-in makes any changes to the disassembly, it creates a backup of the current IDA database file (IDB).
