Since the pre-trained GPT-2 model's dataset consisted of 40+ GB of Internet text data extracted from 8+ million reputable web pages, its generations display relatively formal grammar, punctuation, and structure that corresponds to the text present within that original dataset (e.g. Figure 1).
To make it appear like social media posts with their shorter length, informal grammar, erratic punctuation, and syntactic quirks including @mentions, #hashtags, emojis, acronyms, and abbreviations, we fine-tuned the pre-trained GPT-2 model on a new language modeling task using additional training data.
