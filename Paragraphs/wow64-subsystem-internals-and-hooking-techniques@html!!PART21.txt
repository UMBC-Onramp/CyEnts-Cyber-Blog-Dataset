If the 64-bit hook detects an invocation that didn’t also pass through the 32-bit hook, then it’s known that a sample is utilizing Heaven’s Gate.
This technique can detect both evasion techniques previously detailed.
However, in practice this is very difficult to implement.
Looking at the requirements that must be satisfied to hook the 64-bit syscall stub we come up with this list: Install 64-bit hook from a 32-bit module How do you read/write 64-bit address space from a 32-bit module?
Implement a 64-bit callback from a 32-bit module Typically, inline hooking uses C functions as callback stubs, but we’re compiling a 32-bit module so we’ll have a 32-bit callback instead of the required 64-bit one.
