Next, the backdoor only executes if the filesystem last write time of the .NET assembly SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is at least 12 to 14 days prior to the current time.
The exact threshold is selected randomly from this interval.
In other words, SUNBURST lays low for almost two weeks before raising its head.
If the timestamp check fails, the backdoor will execute again at a random later time when it is invoked by a legitimate recurring background task.
Once the threshold is met, the sample creates the named pipe 583da945-62af-10e8-4902-a8f205c72b2e to ensure only one instance of the backdoor is running.
If the named pipe already exists, the malware exits.
SUNBURST stores its configuration in the legitimate SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config file.
