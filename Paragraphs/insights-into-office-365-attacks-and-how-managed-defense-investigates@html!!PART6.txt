Entries in the UAL are stored in JSON format.
We recommend using the PowerShell cmdlet Search-UnifiedAuditLog to query the UAL as it allows for greater flexibility, though it can also be acquired from the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center located at protection.office.com .
In order to leverage this log source (and the Admin Audit Log), ensure that the Audit Log Search feature is enabled.
The UAL has a few nuances that are important to consider.
While it provides a good high-level summary of activity across various O365 applications, it won’t log comprehensive mailbox activity (for that, acquire the Mailbox Audit Log).
Furthermore, the UAL has a few limitations, namely: Results to a single query are limited to 5000 results Only 90 days of activity are retained Events may take up to 24 hours before they are searchable Mailbox Audit Log (MAL)
The Mailbox Audit Log, part of Exchange Online, will capture additional actions performed against objects within a mailbox.
As such, it’s a good idea acquire and analyze the MAL for each affected user account with the PowerShell cmdlet Search-MailboxAuditLog .
Note that entries in the MAL will be retained for 90 days (by default) and timestamps will be based on the user’s local time zone.
The MAL’s retention time can always be increased with the PowerShell cmdlet Set-Mailbox along with the AuditLogAgeLimit parameter.
