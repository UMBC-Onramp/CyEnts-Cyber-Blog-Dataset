Technical Indicators
The following are technical indicators we have observed, organized by the threat groups we currently associate with this activity.
To increase investigation transparency, we are including a Last Known True, or LKT, value for network indicators.
The LKT timestamp indicates the last time Mandiant knew the indicator was associated with the adversary; however, as with all ongoing intrusions, a reasonable time window should be considered.
