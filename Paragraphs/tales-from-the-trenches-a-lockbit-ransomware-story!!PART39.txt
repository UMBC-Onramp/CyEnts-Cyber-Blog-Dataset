Unfortunately, this continued for two dubious days with multiple excuses before the attacker sent a link to the decryptor via the chat.
It appeared that they were ineffective in solving the technical issues; hence they chose to send it via SendSpace.
Once downloaded, the recovery phase could start.
In this phase, all servers were decrypted, scanned and cleaned (or rebuilt) in a quarantined network.
Subsequently, after implementing the appropriate technical and security measures, each host joined a new clean network.
Conclusion As we highlighted in the first two articles, targeted ransomware attacks have increased massively over the past months.
Many of them are all using a similar, quite manual, attack pattern as we highlighted.
In this article, we provided an in-depth view of a relatively new ransomware family named LockBit.
Based on a real-life case as encountered by Northwave, we described a typical ransomware attack including the modus operandi of attackers, the recovery process, an insight in the underground that advertises the ransomware and a full technical break-down of the ransomware itself.
Additionally, during our analysis, we were able to obtain multiple samples of the LockBit ransomware with which we could provide an extensive list of IOCs.
 McAfee will continue monitoring this threat.
