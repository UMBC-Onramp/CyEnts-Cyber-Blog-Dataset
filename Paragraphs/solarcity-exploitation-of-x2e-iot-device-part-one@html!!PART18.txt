Chip Removal Physical chip removal is considered a destructive approach but can certainly be performed without damaging the PCB or the flash chip itself.
When presented with removal of BGA packages, the two most common removal techniques are either hot air or infrared light (IR).
Commercial solutions exist for both hot air and IR, but cheaper options exist with hot air removal.
We opted to use hot air on the X2e.
To minimize damage to the PCB and flash, a PCB heater or oven can be used to slowly bring the entire PCB to a temperature right below the solder melting point.
This will reduce the amount of time we need to focus our hot air directly onto the flash IC and help with reducing the heat dissipation into the PCB throughout the process.
One final trick that can be used to minimize nearby chips from being damaged or lost (due to the air pressure) is the use of high-heat resistant tape, commonly referred to as Kapton tape.
Figure 10 shows the PCB wrapped in Kapton tape to protect nearby components.
