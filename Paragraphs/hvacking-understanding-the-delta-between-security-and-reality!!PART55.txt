To help reduce the scope of functions we needed to investigate, we began by focusing our attention on controlling binary output (BO).
Our first challenge was how to find the code that handles changing the state of a binary output.
A couple of key factors helped point us in the right direction.
First, the documentation for the controller indicates the devices talk to the I/O modules over a Controller Area Network Bus (CAN bus), which is common for PLC devices.
