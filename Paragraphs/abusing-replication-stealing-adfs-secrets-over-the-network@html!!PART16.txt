Figure 5: Windows Firewall - Allow ADFS Server - TCP 80 Organizations that are monitoring the internal network can alert on HTTP POST requests to the address that hosts the Policy Store Transfer service.
If there is an AD FS farm, then the IP addresses of the AD FS servers will need to be whitelisted against the rule.
Figure 6 shows a sample Snort rule to detect this activity.

Sample snort rule Acknowledgements Mandiant would like to acknowledge the great work of Dr. Nestori Syynimaa (@DrAzureAD).
Dr. Syynimaa independently thought to research the replication of configuration information between AD FS servers and has published his findings on his blog .
Mandiant would also like to thank Microsoft for their collaboration on mitigations and detections for this technique.
Lastly, special thanks to Mike Burns of the Mandiant Security Transformation services team for his feedback on mitigations and detections.
