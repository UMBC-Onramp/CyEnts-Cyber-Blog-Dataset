Logically segregate primary and redundant assets either by a network-based or host-based firewall with subsequent asset hardening (e.g., disabling services typically used by ransomware for its propagation, like SMB, RDP, and WMI).
In addition to creating policies to disable unnecessary peer-to-peer and remote connections, we recommend routine auditing of all systems that potentially host these services and protocols.
Note that such architecture is generally more resilient to security incidents.
When establishing a rigorous back-up program, special attention should be paid to ensuring the security (integrity) of backups.
Critical backups must be kept offline or, at minimum, on a segregated network.
Optimize recovery plans in terms ofÂ recovery time objective.
Introduce required alternative workflows (including manual) for the duration of recovery.
This is especially critical for organizations with limited or no redundancy of critical assets.
When recovering from backups, harden recovered assets and the entire organization's infrastructure to prevent recurring ransomware infection and propagation.
Establish clear ownership and management of OT perimeter protection devices to ensure emergency, enterprise-wide changes are possible.
Effective network segmentation must be maintained during containment and active intrusions.
Hunt for adversary intrusion activity in intermediary systems , which we define as the networked workstations and servers using standard operating systems and protocols.
