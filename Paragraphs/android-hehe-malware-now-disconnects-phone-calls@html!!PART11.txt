Receivers IncomeCallAndSmsReceiver
The RegisterBroadcastReceiver registers this receiver once the app gets started.
When an SMS is received on the device.
The IncomeCallAndSmsReceiver gets the intent.
Because this receiver listens for one of three intents, any intents received by this receiver are checked for their type.
If the received intent is of type android.provider.telephony.
SMS_RECEIVED , the app extracts the contents of the SMS and the phone number of the sender.
If the first three characters of the phone number matches the first three characters from phone numbers in a table named tbl_intercept_info, then the SMS intent is aborted and the SMS is deleted from the devices SMS inbox so that the user never sees it.
After the SMS notification is suppressed, the app bundles the SMS as follows: {\n\"content\":\"TESTING\", \n\"createTime\":\"2014-01-10 16:21:36\",\n\"id\":null,\"messageFrom\":\"1234567890\",\n\"token\":null\n}\n\nFrom there, it sends the to the CnC server (http://108.62.240.69:9008/reportMessage)
It also records the SMS in the tbl_message_info table in its internal database.
If the received intent is of type android.intent.action.
