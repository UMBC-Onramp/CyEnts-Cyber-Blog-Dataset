Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff kicked off the morning by discussing his perspective on the global threat landscape.
He touched on Iran's cyber warfare capabilities in particular.
He remarked on recent alleged Iranian attacks against the BBC and said that there is no point in debating the reality of cyber war .
If one side believes they are engaged in such a battle, then that is reality-and \"Iran clearly believes they are already participants in cyber war.\" He also noted that Iran's capabilities are already quite advanced.
