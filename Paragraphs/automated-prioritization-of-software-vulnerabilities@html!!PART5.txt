Tweet showing social commentary on a vulnerability that reflects severity Model Overview Figure 2 illustrates the overall process that starts with analyzing the content of a tweet and concludes with two forecasting evaluations.
First, we run Named Entity Recognition (NER) on tweet contents to extract named entities.
Second, we use two classifiers to test the relevancy and severity towards the pre-identified entities.
Finally, we match the relevant and severe tweets to the corresponding CVE.
Figure 2: Process overview of the steps in our CVE score forecasting Each tweet is associated to CVEs by inspecting URLs or the contents hosted at a URL.
