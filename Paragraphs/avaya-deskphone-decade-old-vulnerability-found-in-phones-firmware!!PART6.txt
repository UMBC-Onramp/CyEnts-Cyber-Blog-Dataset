To recover the files, the easiest approach is to look for firmware updates for the device.
If we are lucky, they will be freely available and not encrypted.
In most cases, an encrypted firmware does not increase the security of the system but rather raises the barrier of entry for security researchers and attackers alike.
In this case, we are in luck, Avayaâ€™s website serves firmware updates for its various phone product lines and anyone can download them.
The download contains multiple tar files (a type of archive file format).
We can then run a tool called binwalk on the extracted files.
Binwalk is a large dictionary of patterns that represents known file formats; given an unknown firmware file, it will look for any known pattern and, upon finding potential matches, will attempt to process them accordingly.
For instance, if it finds what looks like a .zip file inside the firmware, it will try to unzip it.
