Actors primarily used Procdump and Mimikatz to collect credentials used to enable later stages of their intrusion.
Notably, both Bloodhound and PingCastle were also used, presumably to enable attackers' efforts to understand the impacted organization's Active Directory configuration.
In this case the responsible actors also attempted to exfiltrate collected credentials to multiple different cloud file storage services.
Reconnaissance Mandiant has observed a broad range of approaches to network, host, data, and Active Directory reconnaissance across observed MAZE incidents.
The varied tools and approaches across these incidents maybe best highlights the divergent ways in which the responsible actors interact with victim networks.
In some intrusions, reconnaissance activity occurred within three days of gaining initial access to the victim network.
The responsible actor executed a large number of reconnaissance scripts via Cobalt Strike to collect network, host, filesystem, and domain related information.
