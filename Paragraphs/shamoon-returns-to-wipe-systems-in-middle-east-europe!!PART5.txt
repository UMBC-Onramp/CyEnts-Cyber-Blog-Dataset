Shamoon is modular malware:
The wiper component can be reused as a standalone file and weaponized in other attacks, making this threat a high risk.
The post presents our findings, including a detailed analysis and indicators of compromise.
Analysis Shamoon is a dropper that carries three resources.
The dropper is responsible for collecting data as well as embedding evasion techniques such as obfuscation, antidebugging, or antiforensic tricks.
The dropper requires an argument to run.
It decrypts the three resources and installs them on the system in the %System% folder.
It also creates the service MaintenaceSrv, which runs the wiper.
The typo in the service name eases detection.
The Advanced Threat Research team has watched this service evolve over the years.
The following tables highlight the differences: The wiper uses ElRawDisk.sys to access the userâ€™s raw disk and overwrites all data in all folders and disk sectors, causing a critical state of the infected machine before it finally reboots.
The result is either a blue screen or driver error that renders the machine unusable.
Overview Dropper Executable summary The dropper contains other malicious components masked as encrypted files embedded in PE section.
