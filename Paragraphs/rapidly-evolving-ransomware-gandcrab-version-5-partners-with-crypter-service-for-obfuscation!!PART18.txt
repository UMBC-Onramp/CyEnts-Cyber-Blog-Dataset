Coverage Customers of McAfee gateway and endpoint products are protected against the latest GandCrab versions.
Detection names include Ran-Gandcrabv4!
and many others.
An independent researcher, Twitter user Valthek, has also created several vaccines.
(McAfee has verified that these vaccines are effective.)
The version for GandCrab 4.x through 5.0.2 can prevent the files from being encrypted.
For Version 4.x, the deletion of shadow volumes cannot be avoided but at least the files themselves are kept safe.
For Version 5.x, encrypting the files can be avoided but not the creation and changing of the wallpaper, which the malware will still corrupt.
The malware cannot create random extensions to encrypt the files but will prepare the string.
Running the vaccine a second time removes the wallpaper if it is in the %TEMP% folder.
The vaccine has versions with and without persistence.
The version with persistence creates a random filename in a special folder and writes a special random entry in the registry to run each time with the system.
In this case, the machine will always be protected against this malware (at least in its current state of October 10, and perhaps in the future).
Indicators of compromise These samples use the following MITRE ATT&CK â„¢ techniques: File deletion System information discovery Execution through API Execution through WMIC Application process discovery: to detect antimalware and security products as well as normal programs Query registry: to get information about keys that the malware needs to create or read Modify registry File and directory discovery: to search for files to encrypt Discovery of network shares to encrypt them Encrypt files Process discovery: enumerating all processes on the endpoint to kill some special ones Create files Elevation of privileges Change wallpaper Flood the network with connections Create mutants Hashes e168e9e0f4f631bafc47ddf23c9848d7: Version 5.0 6884e3541834cc5310a3733f44b38910:
