GeoLogonalyzer would process this application access log and detect that the user account required a FAST travel rate of roughly 1,250 miles per hour which may appear malicious.
Establishing a baseline of legitimate authentication patterns is recommended to understand false positives.
Reliance on Open Source Data GeoLogonalyzer relies on open source data to make cloud hosting provider determinations.
These lookups are only as accurate as the available open source data.
Preventing Remote Access Abuse Understanding that no single analysis method is perfect, the following recommendations can help security teams prevent the abuse of remote access platforms and investigate suspected compromise.
Identify and limit remote access platforms that allow access to sensitive information from the Internet, such as VPN servers, systems with RDP or SSH exposed, third-party applications (e.g., Citrix), intranet sites, and email infrastructure.
Implement a multi-factor authentication solution that utilizes dynamically generated one-time use tokens for all remote access platforms.
