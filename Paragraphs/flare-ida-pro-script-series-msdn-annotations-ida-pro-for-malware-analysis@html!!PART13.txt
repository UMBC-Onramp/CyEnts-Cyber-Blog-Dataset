However, if you want to extend partly existing function information, you only have to add the additional fields.
Name tags are mandatory for this, as they get used to identify the respective element.
For example, if the parser did not recognize a commonly used constant, we could add the information manually.
For the CreateFileA functionâ€™s dwDesiredAccess argument the additional information could look similar to Listing 1.
<?
xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?
> <msdn> <functions> <function> <name>
CreateFileA</name> <arguments> <argument> <name>dwDesiredAccess</name> <constants enums=\"MACRO_GENERIC\"> <constant> <name>
