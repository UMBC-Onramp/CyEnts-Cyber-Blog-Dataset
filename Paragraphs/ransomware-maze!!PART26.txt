THE FILES
The malware tries to make connections to IP addresses that have been crypted in the binary to send information about the infected machine, as seen below: hxxp://91.218.114.4/nwjknpeevx.action?pw=g1y652l&kyn=21y3vvhh&dvr=5e&us=g25e3582a hxxp://91.218.114.11/forum/siaib.jspx?v=h&xyna=0vip863&eul=xsn3q0 hxxp://91.218.114.26/view/ticket/pigut.jspx?o=664quo0s&fp=ot52 hxxp://91.218.114.25/xrr.jspx?ygad=r35e2cx&e=6as6ta hxxp://91.218.114.4/j.php hxxp://91.218.114.11/payout/view/fa.aspx?y=y&qbx=4&kws=n2&iuy=8k7 hxxp://91.218.114.25/lxh.asp?mtxm=l7&r=836wy5 hxxp://91.218.114.26/signin/ticket/eq.action?x=yk6rr&e=50b&q=327dr5&ofk=065cdp hxxp://91.218.114.31/signin/rnmnnekca.jsp?kdn=6snl5&e=7a50cx4hyp hxxp://91.218.114.31/forum/a.aspx?byx=56&bc=62t0h&u=75w6n6&sot=2v0l761or6 hxxp://91.218.114.32/withdrawal/checkout/l.do?nuny=qj6&sdv=45g2boyf5q&dnr=rh8lk31ed

The IP addresses are detected as from the Russian Federation but that does not prove that the malware came from this country; it could be deliberate misdirection but, with the language checks of CIS countries, it certainly appears possible.
