Reconnaissance commands were regularly issued to the bots, with the goal of collecting information that would allow the botnet’s operators to zero in on valuable assets.
The information the attackers looked for was root access, CPU and GPU information and system architecture (ARMV, etc.)
Most notably, the Blackcat botnet operators were eager to find machines with NVIDIA GPUs , which is a graphic processing unit with higher compute power that translates into faster mining.
Once the server’s operators get the information on the system’s CPU/GPU, they group the bots in different channels accordingly.
