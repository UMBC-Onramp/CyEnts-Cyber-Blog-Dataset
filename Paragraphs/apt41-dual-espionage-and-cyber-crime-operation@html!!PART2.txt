The group has established and maintained strategic access to organizations in the healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors.
APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance.
For example, the group has repeatedly targeted call record information at telecom companies.
In another instance, APT41 targeted a hotel’s reservation systems ahead of Chinese officials staying there, suggesting the group was tasked to reconnoiter the facility for security reasons.
The group’s financially motivated activity has primarily focused on the video game industry, where APT41 has manipulated virtual currencies and even attempted to deploy ransomware.
The group is adept at moving laterally within targeted networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, until it can access game production environments.
From there, the group steals source code as well as digital certificates which are then used to sign malware.
