We believe these numbers to be conservative estimates, as we relied on the first reported exploitation of a vulnerability linked to a specific date.
Frequently, first exploitation dates are not publicly disclosed.
It is also likely that in some cases exploitation occurred without being discovered before researchers recorded exploitation attached to a certain date.
Figure 2:
Time between vulnerability exploitation and patch issuance ­­­ Time Between Disclosure and Patch Release
The average time between disclosure and patch availability was approximately 9 days.
This average is slightly inflated by vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-0863, a Microsoft Windows server vulnerability, which was disclosed in December 2018 and not patched until 5 months later in May 2019.
The majority of these vulnerabilities, however, were patched quickly after disclosure.
In 59% of cases, a patch was released on the same day the vulnerability was disclosed.
