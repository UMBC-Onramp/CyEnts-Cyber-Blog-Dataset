Ransomware can get onto your computer in a variety of ways.
For example, you might plug in an infected flash drive or download something from a shady website.
E-mails with dangerous attachments or links to malicious sites are the most common sources of infection.
Perhaps the most unpleasant aspect of many ransomware programs is their ability to spread across devices on the same network.
That means if your home desktop picks up malware, you can expect an attack on your laptop as well.
And one piece of ransomware on a work device can bring all corporate communications to a standstill.
