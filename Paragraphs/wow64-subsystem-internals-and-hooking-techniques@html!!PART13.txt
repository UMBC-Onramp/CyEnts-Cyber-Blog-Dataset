To summarize the post, for functions that have simple arguments with widths <= sizeof(uint32_t) the WOW64 layer will directly widen these arguments to 64 bits via zero or sign-extension and then perform a direct syscall into the kernel.
This all occurs within wow64cpu, rather than executing a more complex path detailed as follows.
This acts as an optimization.
For more complex functions that do not support TurboThunks the TurboDispatchJumpAddressEnd stub is used which dispatches to wow64!SystemServiceEx to perform the system call as shown in Figure 10.
