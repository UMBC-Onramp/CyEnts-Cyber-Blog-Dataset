Introduction On Feb. 19, IBM XForce researchers released an intelligence report [ 1 ] stating that the source code for GM Bot was leaked to a crimeware forum in December 2015.
GM Bot is a sophisticated Android malware family that emerged in the Russian-speaking cybercrime underground in late 2014.
IBM also claimed that several Android malware families recently described in the security community were actually variants of GM Bot, including Bankosy[ 2 ], MazarBot[ 3 ], and the SlemBunk malware recently described by FireEye[ 4 , 5 ].
Security vendors may differ in their definition of a malware “variant.”
The term may refer to anything from almost identical code with slight modifications, to code that has superficial similarities (such as similar network traffic) yet is otherwise very different.
Using IBM’s reporting, we compared their GM Bot samples to SlemBunk.
Based on the disassembled code of these two families, we agree that there are enough code similarities to indicate that GM Bot shares a common origin with SlemBunk.
