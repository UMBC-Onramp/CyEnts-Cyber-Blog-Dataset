APT39 SSH Tunneling After observing APT39 in a series of intrusions, we determined they frequently created Secure Shell (SSH) tunnels with PuTTY Link to forward Remote Desktop Protocol connections to internal hosts within the target environment.
Additionally, they preferred using BitVise SSH servers listening on port 443.
Finally, they were using servers hosted by WorldStream B.V.
Independent isolation of any one of these characteristics would produce a lot of unrelated servers; however, the aggregation of characteristics provided a strong signal for newly established infrastructure of interest.
