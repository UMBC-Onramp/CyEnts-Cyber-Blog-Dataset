Shellcode Shellcode is passed to the exploit from HTML in flashvars.
The shellcode downloads the next stage payload, which is an executable passed in plaintext, to the temp directory with UrlDownloadToFileA, which it then runs with WinExec.
Payload & C2
This exploit delivers a malware variant that shares characteristics with the APT28 backdoors CHOPSTICK and CORESHELL malware families, both described in our APT28 whitepaper .
  
The malware uses an RC4 encryption key that was previously used by the CHOPSTICK backdoor.
  
And the C2 messages include a checksum algorithm that resembles those used in CHOPSTICK backdoor communications.
  
In addition, the network beacon traffic for the new malware resembles those used by the CORESHELL backdoor.
  Like CORESHELL, one of the beacons includes a process listing from the victim host.
  
And like CORESHELL, the new malware attempts to download a second-stage executable.
One of the C2 locations for the new payload, 87.236.215[.]246 , also hosts a suspected APT28 domain ssl-icloud[.]com .
  
The same subnet ( 87.236.215.0/24 ) also hosts several known or suspected APT28 domains, as seen in Table 1.
The target firm is an international government entity in an industry vertical that aligns with known APT28 targeting.
CVE-2015-1701 Exploit The payload contains an exploit for the unpatched local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2015-1701 in Microsoft Windows.
The exploit uses CVE-2015-1701 to execute a callback in userspace.
The callback gets the EPROCESS structures of the current process and the System process, and copies data from the System token into the token of the current process.
Upon completion, the payload continues execution in usermode with the privileges of the System process.
Because CVE-2015-3043 is already patched, this remote exploit will not succeed on a fully patched system.
If an attacker wanted to exploit CVE-2015-1701, they would first have to be executing code on the victim’s machine.
Barring authorized access to the victim’s machine, the attacker would have to find some other means, such as crafting a new Flash exploit, to deliver a CVE-2015-1701 payload.
Microsoft is aware of CVE-2015-1701 and is working on a fix.
CVE-2015-1701 does not affect Windows 8 and later.
