Despite these limitations, as financial AI tools become more popular, adversarial methods to exploit these tools are also likely to become more commonplace on underground forums and via state-sponsored threats.
Future financially motivated operations could monitor or manipulate trade simulation tools as another means of gaining advanced knowledge of upcoming market activity.
Risk Assessment and Modeling Use AI can help the financial insurance sector's underwriting process by examining client data and highlighting features that it considers vulnerable prior to market-moving actions (joint ventures, mergers & acquisitions, research & development breakthroughs, etc.).
Creating an accurate insurance policy ahead of market catalysts requires a risk assessment to highlight a client's potential weaknesses.
Financial services can also employ AI applications to improve their risk models .
Advances in generative adversarial networks can help risk management by stress-testing a firm's internal risk model to evaluate performance or highlight potential vulnerabilities in a firm's model.
Potential Exploitation
If a country is conducting market-moving events with a foreign business, state-sponsored espionage actors could use data poisoning attacks to cause AI models to over or underestimate the value or risk associated with a firm to gain a competitive advantage ahead of planned trade activity.
