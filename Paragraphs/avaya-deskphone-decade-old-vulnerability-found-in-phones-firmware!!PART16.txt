While poking around, it becomes clear that one of the utilities, dhclient, is of great interest.
It is already running on the system and handles network configuration (the so-called DHCP requests to configure the phone’s IP address).
If we invoke it in the command line, the following is printed: Showing a detailed help screen describing its expected arguments is normal behavior, but a 2004-2007 copyright is a big red flag.
A quick search confirms that the 4.0.0 version is more than 10 years old and, even worse, an exploit targeting it is publicly available.
Dhclient code is open source, so finding the differences between two successive version is straightforward.
Studying the exploit code and how the bug was patched helps us to narrow down which part of the code could be vulnerable.
By once again using a disassembler, we confirm the phone’s version of dhclient is indeed vulnerable to the bug reported in 2009.
