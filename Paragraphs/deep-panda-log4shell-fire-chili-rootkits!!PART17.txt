NSI_PARAM contains connection data such as IP, port, connection state, and process IDs of the executables in charge of creating the connection.
The filter function iterates this structure, searching for connections involving a process or port number from its global network list.
All identified connections are removed from the structure, rendering them hidden from the process that sent the IOCTL.
It is interesting to note that the newer build of the 64-bit rootkit added support to filter IOCTLs from 32-bit processes as well.
