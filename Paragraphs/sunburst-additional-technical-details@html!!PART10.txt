SUNBURST will not treat the services it has disabled as members of the blocklist anymore.
Therefore, during an incident response, forensic teams should consider recovering and decoding this configuration key to parse out which services SUNBURST attempted to disable.
Domain Generation Algorithm In this section we describe how SUNBURST uses an intermediary command and control (C2) coordinator to retrieve its final C2 server.
The C2 coordinator instructs the backdoor to continue or halt beaconing.
It also redirects SUNBURST to its final C2 server via DNS CNAME records.
