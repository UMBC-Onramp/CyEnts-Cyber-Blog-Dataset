INDX_ROOT.bin icat -f ntfs ntfs.dd 49-160-7 > INDX_ALLOCATION.bin
The icat command uses the NTFS module to identify the record (49) attribute (144-6 and 144-7), and outputs the attribute data into the respective files INDX_ROOT.bin and INDX_ALLOCATION.bin.
EnCase We can use EnCase to extract the INDX allocation data.
To use EnCase version 6.x to gather the content of the INDX buffers, in the explorer tree, right click the folder icon.
The \"Copy/UnErase...\" option applied to a directory will copy the content of the INDX buffer as a binary file.
Specify a location to save the file.
Note that the \"Copy Folders...\" option will copy the directory and its contents and will NOT extract the INDX structure.
FTK We can use the Forensic Toolkit (FTK) to extract the INDX allocation data.
Using FTK or FTK Imager, the INDX allocation attributes appear in the file list pane.
