What Is the CUCM Product?
The CUCM solution is a middleware component that allows enterprises to integrate their various communication devices and manage them using one platform.
In short, it unifies voice, video, data and mobile applications on fixed and mobile networks.
Starting with the Cisco Unified Communications 9.0, the Cisco Unified Presence technology is integrated within the CUCM.
Nowadays, most people refer to this solution as the CUCM IM & Presence Service.
Almost every customer that uses the Cisco Jabber instant messaging application has the CUCM IM & Presence deployment.
