For example, last spring cybercriminals used a malicious advertisement SDK to infect APKPure, a popular alternative Android app store.
Fortunately, its developers took security seriously, and released a clean version a day after we got in touch with them.
A similar story happened with the popular WhatsApp mod FMWhatsApp: one of the versions of the app harbored the Triada Trojan inside an advertisement SDK.
This Trojan is infamous for being very difficult to remove from an infected device.
Moreover, Triada rarely comes alone and tends to download a bunch of other malicious apps onto the victimâ€™s device.
