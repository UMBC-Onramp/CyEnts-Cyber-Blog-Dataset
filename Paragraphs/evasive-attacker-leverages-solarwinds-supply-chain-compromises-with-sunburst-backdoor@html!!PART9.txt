(Note: IP Scan history often shows IPs switching between default (WIN-*) hostnames and victim’s hostnames)
Cross-referencing the list of IPs identified in internet scan data with remote access logs may identify evidence of this actor in an environment.
There is likely to be a single account per IP address.
IP Addresses located in Victim’s Country
The attacker’s choice of IP addresses was also optimized to evade detection.
The attacker primarily used only IP addresses originating from the same country as the victim, leveraging Virtual Private Servers.
Detection Opportunity
This also presents some detection opportunities, as geolocating IP addresses used for remote access may show an impossible rate of travel if a compromised account is being used by the legitimate user and the attacker from disparate IP addresses.
The attacker used multiple IP addresses per VPS provider, so once a malicious login from an unusual ASN is identified, looking at all logins from that ASN can help detect additional malicious activity.
