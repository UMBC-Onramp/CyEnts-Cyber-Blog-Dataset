I think that the majority of folks reading this blog have encountered malware that maintains persistence via the startup folder.
The startup folder is a directory that may contain binaries, scripts or shortcut files.
A folder exists for each user on the system as well as for \"all users.\" On Windows 7, for example, the Administrator startup folder resides at \"C:UsersAdministratorAppDataRoamingMicrosoftWindowsStart MenuProgramsStartup\".
When a user successfully authenticates, Windows will attempt to execute any binary, run any script, or follow-up and execute any shortcut that is present within that user's startup folder.
If scripts or applications are placed in the \"all users\" startup folder, these will be executed shortly after the system boots.
