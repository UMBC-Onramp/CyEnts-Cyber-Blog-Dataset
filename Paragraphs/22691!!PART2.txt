Leaving aside the current pros and cons performance-wise, we took a look at the innovation from a security perspective.
Bad news: Just a few months after the release of the first Apple M1 computers, virus writers had already adapted several malware families to the new processor.
What makes Apple M1 malware unique?
In terms of malicious functionality, absolutely nothing distinguishes M1 malware from “regular” malware.
It can run natively on Mac computers with M1 chips, that’s the difference.
Developers recompiled their code and adapted the malware to the new architecture to make it work more efficiently.
Essentially, the M1 adaptation drive is just more evidence that virus writers are motivated to keep their creations up to date.
Does that mean old malware doesn’t work on computers with the Apple M1?
Unfortunately, malware adapted for M1 is an addition, not merely a replacement.
Apple uses the Rosetta 2 system to make the transition from one platform to another seamless.
Roughly speaking, it translates old program code written for the Intel x86 series into a form that the M1 can digest.
Rosetta doesn’t distinguish legitimate programs from malicious ones; it runs x86 malware as readily as any other app.
