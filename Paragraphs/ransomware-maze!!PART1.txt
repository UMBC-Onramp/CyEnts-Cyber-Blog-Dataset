The Maze ransomware, previously known in the community as “ChaCha ransomware”, was discovered on May the 29th 2019 by Jerome Segura [1] .
The main goal of the ransomware is to crypt all files that it can in an infected system and then demand a ransom to recover the files.
However, the most important characteristic of Maze is the threat that the malware authors give to the victims that, if they do not pay , they will release the information on the Internet [2] .
This threat has not been an idle one as the files of one company were indeed released on the Internet.
Even though the company sued, the damage was already done.
This is a behavior increasingly observed in new ransomware [3] , such as Sodinokibi, Nemty, Clop and others.
