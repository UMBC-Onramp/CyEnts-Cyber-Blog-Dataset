  Rovio offers a newsletter to update Angry Birds players with new games, episodes, and special offers.
  During newsletter signup, Rovio collects the player’s first and last name, email address, date of birth, country of residence, and gender.
This information is aggregated with the user’s Rovio account profile by matching the player’s email address.
