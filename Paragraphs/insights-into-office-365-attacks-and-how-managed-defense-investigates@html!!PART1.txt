With Business Email Compromises (BECs) showing no signs of slowing down , it is becoming increasingly important for security analysts to understand Office 365 (O365) breaches and how to properly investigate them.
This blog post is for those who have yet to dip their toes into the waters of an O365 BEC, providing a crash course on Microsoft’s cloud productivity suite and its assortment of logs and data sources useful to investigators.
We’ll also go over common attacker tactics we’ve observed while responding to BECs and provide insight into how Mandiant Managed Defense analysts approach these investigations at our customers using PowerShell and the FireEye Helix platform .
Office 365 Office 365 is Microsoft’s cloud-based subscription service for the Microsoft Office suite.
It is built from dozens of applications tightly embedded into the lives of today’s workforce, including: Exchange Online, for emails SharePoint, for intranet portals and document sharing Teams and Skype for Business, for instant messaging OneDrive, for file sharing Microsoft Stream, for recorded meetings and presentations As more and more organizations decide to adopt Microsoft’s cloud-based offering to meet their needs, unauthorized access to these O365 environments, or tenants in Microsoft’s parlance, has become increasingly lucrative to motivated attackers.
The current high adoption rate of O365 means that attackers are getting plenty of hands on experience with using and abusing the platform.
While many tactics have remained largely unchanged in the years since we’ve first observed them, we’ve also witnessed the evolution of techniques that are effective against even security-conscious users.
In general, the O365 compromises we’ve responded to have fallen into two categories: Business Email Compromises (BECs) APT or state-sponsored intrusions Based on our experience, BECs are a common threat to any organization's O365 tenant.
