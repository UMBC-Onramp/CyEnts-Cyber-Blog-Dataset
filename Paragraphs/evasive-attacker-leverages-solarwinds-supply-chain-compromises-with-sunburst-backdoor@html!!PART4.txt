The trojanized update file is a standard Windows Installer Patch file that includes compressed resources associated with the update, including the trojanized SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll component.
Once the update is installed, the malicious DLL will be loaded by the legitimateÂ SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe or SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHostx64.exe (depending on system configuration).
After a dormant period of up to two weeks, the malware will attempt to resolve a subdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com.
The DNS response will return a CNAME record that points to a Command and Control (C2) domain.
The C2 traffic to the malicious domains is designed to mimic normal SolarWinds API communications.
