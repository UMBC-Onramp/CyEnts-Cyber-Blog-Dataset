We saw a similar situation in the spring of 2021 with the APKPure unofficial app store, whose developers also used an ad module from an unverified source, thereby infecting their creation , and consequently users, with the Triada Trojan (albeit a slightly different version).
As in the case of the infected APKPure, the Triada Trojan in the dangerous version of the FMWhatsApp mod performs an intermediary function.
First, it collects data about the user’s device, and then, depending on the information, it downloads another Trojan.
Triada’s “extras” come in a variety of flavors — the infected version of FMWhatsApp downloads several types of malware to devices: Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Agent.ic, a Trojan that downloads and runs other malicious modules; Trojan-Downloader.
AndroidOS.Gapac.e, which downloads and runs other malicious modules and can also display full-screen ads at unexpected moments; Trojan-Downloader.
AndroidOS.Helper.a, which downloads and runs the installer module of the xHelper Trojan and runs invisible ads in the background; Trojan.
