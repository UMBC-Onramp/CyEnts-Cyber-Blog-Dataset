We have published a new tool called SSSDKCMExtractor that will decrypt relevant secrets in the SSSD database and pull out Â the credential cache Kerberos blob.
This blob can be converted into a usable Kerberos CCache file that can be passed to other tools, such as Mimikatz , Impacket , and smbclient .
CCache files can be converted into Windows format using tools such as Kekeo .
We leave it as an exercise to the reader to convert the decrypted Kerberos blob into a usable credential cache file for pass-the-cache and pass-the-ticket operations.
Using SSSDKCMExtractor is simple.
An example SSSD KCM database and key are shown in Figure 2.
