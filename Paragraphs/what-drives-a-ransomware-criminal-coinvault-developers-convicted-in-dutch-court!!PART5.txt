The infection The two brothers did not directly infect their victims with ransomware; they took a multistep approach.
Their distribution method was via newsgroup channels.
They hooked a small piece of malicious code to known software or license-key generators before posting the software packages on the newsgroups.
Once victims installed the package or ran the key generator, they would become part of a botnet through the software the brothers named Comhost, which can record keystrokes, search for credentials, and steal Bitcoin wallets.
Comhost can also upload and execute binaries received from the control server they named Sonar.
(We believe Sonar is modified a version of the popular Solar botnet software.)

Once they had accumulated enough bots, they simply pushed CoinVault to all their victims and locked thousands of computers at once.
This method made it hard for victims to figure out how they were attacked, because weeks could pass between the initial infection and the encryption.
By spreading their ransomware via newsgroups with pirated software, they discouraged victims from going to the police out of fear of prosecution and copyright-violation fines.
