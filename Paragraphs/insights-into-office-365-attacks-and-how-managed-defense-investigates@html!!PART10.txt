Message Traces Message traces record the emails sent and received by a user.
During an investigation, run reports on any email addresses of interest.
The message trace report will contain detailed mail flow information as well as subject lines, original client IP addresses, and message sizes.
Message traces are useful for identifying emails sent by attackers from compromised accounts, and can also aid in identifying initial phishing emails if phishing was used for initial access.
To obtain the actual emails, use the Content Search tool.
Only the past 10 days of activity is available with the Get-MessageTrace PowerShell cmdlet.
Historical searches for older messages can be run with the Get-HistoricalSearch cmdlet (up to 90 days by default), but historical searches typically take hours for the report to be available.
Historical reports can also be generated within the Security and Compliance Center.
eDiscovery Content Searches The Content Search tool allows investigators to query for emails, documents, and instant message conversations stored in an Office 365 tenant.
We frequently run Content Search queries to find and acquire copies of emails sent by attackers.
Content searches are limited to what has been indexed by Microsoft, so recent activity may not immediately appear.
