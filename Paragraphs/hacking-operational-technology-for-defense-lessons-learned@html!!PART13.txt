Using OT credentials retrieved in the previous phases, we authenticated to the SMB service (using single factor authentication) by pivoting through the patch management server in the DMZ network.
This enabled us to execute remote console commands on management servers (such as the domain controller) in the OT network.
With access to the domain controller in the core OT network, we extracted credentials for high privilege domain administrator accounts in the OT network using DCSYNC and Mimikatz.
Using these accounts, we gained control of management servers, application servers, and operator workstations in the OT network.
