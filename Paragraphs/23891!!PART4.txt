Your device needs to be connected to a Wi-Fi network to install the patch.
If your device does not yet show a notification that the update is ready for installation, you can force your system into updating a little bit quicker: go to the system settings yourself (Settings → General → Software update) and check the availability of software updates.
In order to get alerts about the latest cyberthreats directly related to your devices and apps, we recommend using the Kaspersky Security Cloud , available for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS operating systems.
When a new vulnerability in the software you use, or a data leak on the website you visit is discovered, you will get a notification with advice on how to protect yourself.
