This decrypted value is a filename which the sample then opens, reads, RC4 encrypts with the same key, base64 encodes, then writes to stdout.

Integrity Checker Tool and Other Validation Checks
In our public report, we noted two code families that manipulate check_integrity.sh, a legitimate script used during a normal system upgrade.
This validation script was modified by the actor to exit early so that it would not perform the intended checks.
Per Ivanti, the validation provided by check_integrity.sh is a separate validation feature and not the same as the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) available on their website.
They recommend that organizations use the online ICT to confirm that hashes of files on their Pulse Secure devices match Ivanti’s list of known good hashes.
Please note that the ICT does not scan the rollback partition.
