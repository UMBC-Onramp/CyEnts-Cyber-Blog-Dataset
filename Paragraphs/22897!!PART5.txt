Now all that stood between the artist and the perfect job was a couple of formal procedures: some software and hardware requirements including a MacBook Pro with certain specs, a graphic-design package, a screen-calibration tool, and a time-tracking system — nothing implausible, but the equipment had to be purchased from a particular vendor.
