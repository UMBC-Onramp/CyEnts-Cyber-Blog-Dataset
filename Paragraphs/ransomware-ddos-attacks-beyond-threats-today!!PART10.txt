Social attacks are designed to take advantage of our natural, social tendencies.
By educating staff about common phishing techniques, appropriate threat responses and making it clear that risk reporting — either of a potential phish or already clicked links — will be met with immediate action, companies can create a culture that prioritizes safety over speed.
Watching for Threats Beyond Ransomware While ransomware remains a substantive risk, other threats are similarly frightening.
But at the same time, compromised third-party software, MITM attacks, DDoS attacks and social engineering can be mitigated with robust security management.
