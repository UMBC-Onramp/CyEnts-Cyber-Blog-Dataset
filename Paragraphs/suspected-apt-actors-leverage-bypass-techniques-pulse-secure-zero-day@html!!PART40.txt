The file licenseserverproto.cgi (SHA256: 168976797d5af7071df257e91fcc31ce1d6e59c72ca9e2f50c8b5b3177ad83cc ) is a webshell implemented via modification of a legitimate Perl script used by a Pulse Secure tool which enables arbitrary command execution.
The attacker inserted two blocks of Perl code that implement the webshell.
The source code modifications are surrounded by comments that indicate the start and end of inserted code.
