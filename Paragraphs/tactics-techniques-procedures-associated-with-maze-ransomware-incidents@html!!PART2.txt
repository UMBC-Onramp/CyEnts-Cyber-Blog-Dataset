Multiple actors are involved in MAZE ransomware operations, based on our observations of alleged users in underground forums and distinct tactics, techniques, and procedures across Mandiant incident response engagements.
Actors behind MAZE also maintain a public-facing website where they post data stolen from victims who refuse to pay an extortion fee.
The combination of these two damaging intrusion outcomes—dumping sensitive data and disrupting enterprise networks—with a criminal service makes MAZE a notable threat to many organizations.
This blog post is based on information derived from numerous Mandiant incident response engagements and our own research into the MAZE ecosystem and operations.
Mandiant Threat Intelligence will be available to answer questions on the MAZE ransomware threat in a May 21 webinar .
Victimology We are aware of more than 100 alleged MAZE victims reported by various media outlets and on the MAZE website since November 2019.
These organizations have been primarily based in North America, although victims spanned nearly every geographical region.
Nearly every industry sector including manufacturing, legal, financial services, construction, healthcare, technology, retail, and government has been impacted demonstrating that indiscriminate nature of these operations (Figure 1).
