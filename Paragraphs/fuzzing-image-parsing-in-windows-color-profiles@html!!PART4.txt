In this blog post, I am going to concentrate on ICC color profiles.
Microsoft has a list of supported Windows APIs .
Looking into some of the obviously named APIs, such as OpenColorProfile , we can see that it is implemented in MSCMS.dll.
This DLL is a generic entry point and supports loading of Microsoft’s Color Management Module (CMM) and third-party CMMs such as Adobe’s CMM.
Microsoft’s CMM—the ICM—can be found as ICM32.dll in system32 directory.
Figure 1: ICM32 Windows’ CMM was written by a third-party during the Windows 95 era and still ships more or less with the same code (with security fixes over the decades).
Seeing such an old module gives me some hope of finding a new vulnerability.
But this is also a small module that may have gone through multiple rounds of review and fuzzing: both by internal product security teams and by external researchers, reducing my hopes to a certain degree.
