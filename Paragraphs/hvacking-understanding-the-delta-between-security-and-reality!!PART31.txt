The check came back with only NX enabled.
This also held true for each of the shared libraries where the vulnerable code is located.
As discussed above, the vulnerability allows for a write-what-where condition, which leads us to the most important question: what do we want to write where?
Ultimately, we want to write shellcode somewhere in memory and then jump to that shellcode.
Since the attacker controls the last packet sent, it is plausible that the attacker could have their shellcode on the stack.
