THE ACTIVITY OF ID NUMBER 41 (PARENT) AND ITS CORRESPONDING SUB_IDs (CHILDREN) ID
Increments Overall, we observed a gradual increment in the ID number over time.
The earlier versions generally had lower ID numbers and higher ID numbers appeared with the later versions.
However, there were relatively lower ID numbers that appeared in many versions, as shown in figure 3.
This observation aligned with our theory that the ID number corresponds with a particular affiliate.
Certain affiliates remained partners for a long period of time, spreading different versions of GandCrab; this explains the ID number appearing over a longer period and in different versions.
This theory has also been acknowledged by several (anonymous) sources.
Determining Top IDâ€™s/Affiliates When we applied the theory that the ID corresponded with an affiliate, we observed different activity amongst the affiliates.
