After the configuration is created or read from, SUNSHUTTLE enters a routine named “﻿main_request_session_key”.
The malware will iterate over this routine until it’s successful, sleeping a period of time after each iteration.
Inside the “﻿main_request_session_key” routine, SUNSHUTTLE constructs an HTTPS request to its configured C2.
Upon an HTTP 200 response from the request, the response data from the C2 is expected to not contain the following string for the sample analyzed: ywQdjLuHHC The request_session_key routine returns a 1 if the string is not in the response and a -1 if it is in the response.
If the result of the request_session_key is 1, SUNSHUTTLE will execute the retrieve_session_key routine.
The retrieve_session_key routine again contacts the C2 and downloads content that is expected to be decrypted by the aforementioned embedded private key.
The decrypted content is likely a session key used to encrypt content once SUNSHUTTLE transitions to its command-and-control routines.
Commanding Once a session key is retrieved from the C2, SUNSHUTTLE begins the beaconing and “resolve_command” routines in a loop.
