Three years later, September 2021 saw the first real-life attack using Spectre v1.
Known as Spook.js, the attack concept is complicated, but we will try to strip it down.
Spectre v1 background News of the first two attacks of this family — Spectre and Meltdown — broke in 2018 .
The attacks exploited the branch prediction mechanism, which is designed to speed up command execution, found in all modern CPUs.
When a user enters a password to log in to a website, if the password is correct, one set of instructions is executed.
If not, another set is executed.
However — and this is where the branch prediction kicks in — before receiving the answer, the CPU starts executing the set of instructions it thinks it will most likely need.
In our example, if the password has been entered correctly a hundred times before, the CPU will assume that this time will be no different.
