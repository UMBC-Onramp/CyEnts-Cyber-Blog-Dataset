However, SimpleLocker has a different financial incentive: to demand a ransom from the victim.
After landing on an Android device, SimpleLocker scans the device for certain file types, encrypts them, and then demands a ransom from the user in order to decrypt the files.
Before SimpleLockerâ€™s emergence, there were other types of Android ransomware that would lock the screen; however, SimpleLocker is believed to be the first file-encryption ransomware on Android.
The earliest report on SimpleLocker we identified was published by ESET in June 2014 [ 6 ].
However, we found an earlier sample in our malware database from May 2014 (SHA256 edff7bb1d351eafbe2b4af1242d11faf7262b87dfc619e977d2af482453b16cb).
The compile date of this app was May 20, 2014.
We compared this SimpleLocker sample to one of our SlemBunk samples (SHA256 f3341fc8d7248b3d4e58a3ee87e4e675b5f6fc37f28644a2c6ca9c4d11c92b96) using the same methods used to compare GM Bot and SlemBunk.
Figure 5 shows the code structure comparison between these two samples.
Note that this SimpleLocker variant also has the major components ServiceStarter and MainService , both used by SlemBunk.
