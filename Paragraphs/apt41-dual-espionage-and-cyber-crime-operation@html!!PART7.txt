APT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems.
The use of bootkits in particular adds an extra layer of stealth because the code is executed prior to the operating system initializing.
The limited use of these tools by APT41 suggests the group reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets.
