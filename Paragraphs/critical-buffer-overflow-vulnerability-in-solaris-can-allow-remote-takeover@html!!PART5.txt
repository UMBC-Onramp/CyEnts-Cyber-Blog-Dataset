The standard OpenSSH client offers all the options needed to trigger the vulnerability (Figure 2).

A server can be quickly tested to see if it is vulnerable over SSH The indication that the server is vulnerable is that the SSH client prints “Authentication failed;” a non-vulnerable PAM library causes the SSH server to repeatedly prompt for a username if it receives one that is too long.
