In January 2021, Mandiant observed a new ransomware deployed against a victim and assigned the name FIVEHANDS.
Analysis of FIVEHANDS revealed high similarity to DEATHRANSOM, sharing several features, functions, and coding similarities.
Absent in FIVEHANDS is a language check, similar to HELLOKITTY Both DEATHRANSOM and FIVEHANDS drops a ransom note in all non-excluded directories Technical Comparison of FIVEHANDS, HELLOKITTY and DEATHRANSOM DEATHRANSOM is written in C while the other two families are written in C++.
DEATHRANSOM uses a distinct series of do/while loops to enumerate through network resources, logical drives, and directories.
It also uses QueueUserWorkItem to implement thread pooling for its file encryption threads.
HELLOKITTY is written in C++, but reimplements a significant portion of DEATHRANSOM's functionality using similar loop operations and thread pooling via QueueUserWorkItem.
The code structure to enumerate network resources, logical drives, and perform file encryption is very similar.
Additionally, HELLOKITTY and DEATHRANSOM share very similar functions to check for the completion status of their encryption threads before exiting.
FIVEHANDS is written in C++ and although high level functionality is similar, the function calls and code structure to implement the majority of the functionality is written differently.
Also, instead of executing threads using QueueUserWorkItem, FIVEHANDS uses IoCompletionPorts to more efficiently manage its encryption threads.
FIVEHANDS also uses more functionality from the C++ standard template library (STL) than does HELLOKITTY.
