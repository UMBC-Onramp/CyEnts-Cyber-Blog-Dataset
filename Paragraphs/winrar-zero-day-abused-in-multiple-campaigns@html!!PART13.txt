FE_Backdoor_EMPIRE Conclusion We have seen how various threat actors are abusing the recently disclosed WinRAR vulnerability using customized decoys and payloads, and by using different propagation techniques such as email and URL.
Because of the huge WinRAR customer-base, lack of auto-update feature and the ease of exploitation of this vulnerability, we believe this will be used by more threat actors in the upcoming days.
Traditional AV solutions will have a hard time providing proactive zero-day detection for unknown malware families.
FireEye MalwareGuard , a component of FireEye Endpoint Security, detects and blocks all the PE executables mentioned in this blog post using machine learning.
It’s also worth noting that this vulnerability allows the malicious ACE file to write a payload to any path if WinRAR has sufficient permissions, so although the exploits that we have seen so far chose to write the payload to startup folder, a more involved threat actor can come up with a different file path to achieve code execution so that any behavior based rules looking for WinRAR writing to the startup folder can be bypassed.
Enterprises should consider blocking vulnerable WinRAR versions and mandate updating WinRAR to the latest version.
FireEye Endpoint Security, FireEye Network Security and FireEye Email Security detect and block these campaigns at several stages of the attack chain.
