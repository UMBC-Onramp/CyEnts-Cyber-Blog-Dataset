Let’s summarize.
You left for lunch with your new Windows Surface Book locked on your desk.
Cortana is on by default on your lock screen.
Your disk is encrypted.
What could go wrong?
Anybody who has physical access to your locked device can start browsing the web.
What if someone were to navigate to a work-unfriendly website from your device, or post inflammatory comments in a public forum that could be attributed to your device’s IP address?
A device-specific attribution would be bad, but could you use the same method to post or access something from a real person’s name or account?
