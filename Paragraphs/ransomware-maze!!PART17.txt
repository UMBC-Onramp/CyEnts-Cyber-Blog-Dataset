Prior to this, the malware gets the function of “WoW64DisableWow64FsRedirection” with “GetProcAddress” and uses it to avoid redirection by default in 64-bit operating systems and calls it in a dynamic way.
The malware tries to delete the shadow copies two times, once before crypting the files in the infected system and secondly after crypting them.
This execution is done with the function “CreateProcessW” but, to increase the level of obfuscation, the malware is launched with this command: FIGURE 16.
DELETION OF SHADOW COPIES IN THE INFECTED SYSTEM WITH THE WMIC COMMAND As you can see in the image above, the malware uses a command with the name of folders that do not exist by default in Windows, except “Windows”, “system32” and “wbem”.
It enters these folders but then promptly exits them using the command “..”, meaning it returns to the previous folder in the path.
