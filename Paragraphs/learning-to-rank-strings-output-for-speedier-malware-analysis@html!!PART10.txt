Contrast the relative ordering of the strings shown here to those otherwise identical lists.
The predicted and sorted string rankings in Figure 3 show network-based indicators on top of the list, followed by registry paths and entries.
These reveal the potential C2 server and malicious behavior on the host.
The subsequent output consisting of user-related information is more likely to be benign, but still worthy of investigation.
Rounding out the list are common strings like Windows API functions and PE artifacts that tend to raise no red flags for the malware analyst.
