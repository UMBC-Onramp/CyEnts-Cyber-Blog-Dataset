Furthermore, UNC1945 operated from several virtual machines pre-configured with post-exploitation tools in addition to their custom toolset to evade detection and forensics.
Initial Compromise In late 2018, UNC1945 gained access to a Solaris server and installed a backdoor we track as SLAPSTICK in order to capture connection details and credentials to facilitate further compromise.
The SSH service of this server was exposed to the internet at the time, the same time we observed first evidence of threat activity.
Unfortunately, due to insufficient available evidence, the next indication of activity was in mid-2020 at which time a different Solaris server was observed connecting to the threat actor infrastructure.
This indicates a dwell time of approximately 519 days based on recovered artifacts.
Although we were unable to determine how the late-2018 initial access was accomplished, we did observe successful UNC1945
SSH connections directly to the victim Solaris 10 server, since the SSH service was exposed directly to the internet at the time.
