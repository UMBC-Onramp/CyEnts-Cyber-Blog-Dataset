Every four years, everyone’s head around the globe turns toward the television.
The Olympics, the World Cup – world events like these have all eyes viewing friendly competition between nations.
Operating under such a big spotlight, these events have been heavily guarded by physical security to ensure no participants or attendees are harmed.
But what about digital security?
In 2018, many aspects of these events have become digitized, which is great for event organizers and viewers, but also for cybercriminals.
In fact, reports are already circulating that hackers are targeting attendees of this year’s 2018 FIFA World Cup .
Why These Events?
The cultural value placed in these international games is precisely the reason cybercriminals target them.
The more something is valued, the more people are willing to make sacrifices for it.
Cybercriminals know that, and hope to capitalize on it.
