Ransomware is a common method of cyber extortion for financial gain that typically involves users being unable to interact with their files, applications or systems until a ransom is paid.
Accessibility of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin has directly contributed to this ransomware model.
Based on data from FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI), ransomware activities have been rising fairly steadily since mid-2015.
On June 10, 2016, FireEyeâ€™s HX detected a Cerber ransomware campaign involving the distribution of emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document attached.
If a recipient were to open the document a malicious macro would contact an attacker-controlled website to download and install the Cerber family of ransomware.
