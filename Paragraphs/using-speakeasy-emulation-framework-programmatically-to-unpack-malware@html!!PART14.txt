Reverse engineering the packer revealed the unpacking stub is ultimately called during initialization of the CWinApp object, which occurs after initialization of the C runtime and MFC.
After attempting to bypass unsupported APIs, I realized that, even if successful, emulation would take far too long to be practical.
I considered skipping over the initialization code completely and jumping straight to the unpacking stub.
Unfortunately, execution of the C-runtime initialization code was required in order for emulation of the unpacking stub to succeed.
My solution was to identify a location in the code that fell after the C-runtime initialization but was early in the MFC initialization routine.
