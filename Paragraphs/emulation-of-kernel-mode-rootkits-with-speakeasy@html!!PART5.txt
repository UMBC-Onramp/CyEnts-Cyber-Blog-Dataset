For most of this post, we will be examining the emulation report generated by Speakeasy.
Note: many techniques employed by this 32-bit rootkit will not work on modern 64-bit versions of Windows due to Kernel Patch Protection (PatchGuard) which protects against modification of critical kernel data structures.
To start, we will instruct Speakeasy to emulate the kernel driver using the command line shown in Figure 1.
We instruct Speakeasy to create a full memory dump (using the “-d” flag) so we can acquire memory later.
