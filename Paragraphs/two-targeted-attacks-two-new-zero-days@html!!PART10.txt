Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP) blocks the attacker’s user-mode callback from executing within kernel-mode and causes the exploits to fail.
Exploits Tool History The exploits are implemented as a command line tool that accepts a single command line argument – a shell command to execute with SYSTEM privileges.
This tool appears to be an updated version of an earlier tool.
The earlier tool exploited CVE-2011-1249, and displays the following usage message to stdout when run: Usage:system_exp.exe cmd Windows Kernel Local Privilege Exploits The vast majority of samples of the earlier tool have compile dates in December 2009.
  Only two samples were discovered with compile dates in March 2011.
Although the two samples exploit the same CVE, they carry a slightly modified usage message of: Usage:local.exe cmd Windows local Exploits The most recent version of the tool, which implements CVE-2014-4113, eliminates all usage messages.
