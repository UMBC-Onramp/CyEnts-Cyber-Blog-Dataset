After successfully escalating privileges on an HP-UX endpoint and a Linux endpoint, UNC1945 installed three backdoors: SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL, and OKSOLO.
We observed UNC1945 use IMPACKET with SMBEXEC in a Microsoft Windows environment to execute commands remotely without the need to upload a payload to the target.
SMBEXEC allows the threat actor to operate like PsExec, but without using RemComSvc.
There are two main modes of using this tool that benefits attackers.
Share mode allows the specification of a share that everything will be executed through.
Server mode permits the output of the executed commands to be sent back by the target machine into a locally shared folder.
