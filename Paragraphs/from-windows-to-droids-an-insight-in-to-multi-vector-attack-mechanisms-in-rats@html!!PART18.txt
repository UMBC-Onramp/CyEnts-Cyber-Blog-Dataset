The startup routine for the GPSTracker class is exactly the same as the one for GlobalService class.
It gets the value from an \"StartGPSTracker\" intent which holds the value for an 'interval' variable as an integer.
 
This app records the GPS location of the device at regular intervals (5 minutes).
It records the location only if the previous location is 200 meters apart from the current location.
When a location has to be added to the database all previous locations are deleted.
Therefore it only maintains the last known location.
This app monitors all incoming messages.
If an SMS with \"[gmyl]\"(Short for (g)ive (m)e (y)our (l)ocation) at the beginning arrives on the device, the corresponding SMS_RECEIVED intent is aborted and the database is queried.
