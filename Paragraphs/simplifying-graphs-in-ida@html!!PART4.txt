By combining these together itâ€™s possible to isolate parts of a control flow graph for in-depth reverse engineering, allowing you to look at Figure 3 instead of Figure 1.
Figure 3: Isolated subgraph to focus on Create Unique-Reachable (UR)
Subgraph Unique-Reachable nodes are all nodes reachable in the graph from a given start node and that are not reachable from any nodes not currently in the UR set.
For example, in Figure 4, all of the Unique-Reachable nodes starting at the green node are highlighted in blue.
The grey node is reachable from the green node, but because it is reachable from other nodes not in the current UR set it is pruned prior to group creation.

Example Unique Reachable selection The plug-in allows you to easily create a new group based on the UR definition.
Select a node in IDA's graph view to be the start of the reachable search.
Right click and select \"SimplifyGraph -> Create unique-reachable group\".
