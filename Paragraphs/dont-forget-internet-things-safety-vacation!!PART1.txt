Home is where the ‘smart’ is.
A recent study revealed the average American household has 25 connected or Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
The number of consumers who have smart home devices connected to their home internet has grown by 38% since the pandemic began.
The findings don’t surprise Brad Ree, the chief technology officer (CTO) of Internet of Things solutions at the ioXt Alliance .
Nor do they surprise Adam Laurie, IBM Security X-Force Red ’s lead hardware hacker.
Ree has more than 80 connected devices in his home.
