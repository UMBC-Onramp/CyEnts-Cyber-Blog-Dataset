It decrypts the configuration with XOR 0xCC ​​​​​​​ and, like the dropper, patches the backdoor’s .data section with it.
The configuration contains the backdoor’s version, C2 server address and service parameters.

Fire Chili Rootkit As part of our research, we have collected four driver samples — two pairs of 32-bit and 64-bit samples.
One pair was compiled in early August 2017 and the second pair was compiled ten days later.
All four driver samples are digitally signed with stolen certificates from game development companies, either the US-based Frostburn Studios or the Korean 433CCR Company (433씨씨알 주식회사).
The signatures made with Frostburn Studios’ certificate are even timestamped.
Two of the samples are on VirusTotal and have a very low detection rate.
The rootkit starts by ensuring the victim machine is not running in safe mode.
It then checks the operating system version.
