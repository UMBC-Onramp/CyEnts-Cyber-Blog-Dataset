Version 5.0 carries two exploits that try to elevate privileges.
It checks the version of the operating system and the TokenIntegrityLevel class of the process.
If the SID Subauthority is SECURITY_MANDATORY_LOW_RID (0x1000), it tries to execute the exploits if it also passed one previous check of a mutex value.
One release is the exploit released in August on Twitter and GitHub by the hacker “SandboxEscaper.”
