For example, one influence campaign we\nuncovered and dubbed \"Distinguished\nImpersonator\" involves falsifying journalist personas and\nreaching out to real-world experts and political figures to\ndisingenuously solicit audio and video interviews that advance an\nIranian political agenda.
Another commonly used tactic is the\ndevelopment of cross-platform online personas that are used to\ninfiltrate target groups or disseminate fabricated content to specific\naudiences, such as in the \"Ghostwriter\"\ncampaign that has leveraged website compromises and used multiple\nwell-developed personas to disseminate fabricated content\naligned with Russian security interests.
And other very common\ntechniques include the use of appropriated photos of real individuals\nto backstop false personas, and the repeated use of identical text on\nsocial media to \"astroturf\" political commentary.
