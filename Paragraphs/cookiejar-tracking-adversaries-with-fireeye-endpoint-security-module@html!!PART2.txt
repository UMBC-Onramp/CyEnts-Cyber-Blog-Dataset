This data is presented in a user interface designed for analyzing investigative leads (e.g., a compromised account) and hunting for suspicious activity (e.g., RDP activity by privileged accounts).
Logon Tracker also provides a graph interface that enables the identification of irregular and unique logons with the option to filter on hostnames, usernames, protocol, time of day, process name, privilege level, status (success/failure), and more.
