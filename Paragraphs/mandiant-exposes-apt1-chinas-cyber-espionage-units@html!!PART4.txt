It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating from China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat the threat effectively.
The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in the public's understanding of the landscape of APT cyber espionage.
Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns.
We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.
