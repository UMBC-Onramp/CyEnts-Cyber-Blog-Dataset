Background Beginning in 2017, the Lazarus group heavily targeted individuals with spear phishing emails impersonating job recruiters which contained malicious documents.
The campaign lasted from April to October and used job descriptions relevant to target organizations, in both English and Korean language.
The objective was to gain access to the targetâ€™s environment and obtain key military program insight or steal money.
The 2017 campaign targets ranged from defense contractors to financial institutions, including crypto currency exchanges, however; much of this fake job recruitment activity ceased months later, with the last activity observed October 22, 2017.
