BitsParser Tool Release
At the time of writing we are not aware of any open source tools available to parse BITS databases and extract data useful for incident response and forensic investigations.
To help address this and foster further research, FireEye has decided to release a standalone version of BitsParser.
This command line utility can process all versions of BITS databases and perform carving to recover deleted job and file information.
Source code for BitsParser can be found at our GitHub page .
Note that on Windows 10 the QMGR database files are opened without sharing by the BITS service thus preventing other programs from directly opening them.
When BitsParser is deployed via the FireEye endpoint agent it can directly parse the local filesystem and raw read files in circumstances where they cannot be directly read.
