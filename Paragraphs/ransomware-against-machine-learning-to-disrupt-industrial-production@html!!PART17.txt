Ransomware may result in similar outcomes when it reaches IT-based assets in OT networks, for example human-machine interfaces (HMIs), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software, and engineering workstations.
Most of this equipment relies on commodity software and standard operating systems that are vulnerable to a variety of IT threats.
Mandiant Intelligence is aware of at least one incident in which an industrial facility suffered a plant shutdown due to a large-scale ransomware attack, based on sensitive sources.
The facility's network was improperly segmented, which allowed the malware to propagate from the corporate network into the OT network, where it encrypted servers, HMIs, workstations, and backups.
The facility had to reach out to multiple vendors to retrieve backups, many of which were decades old, which delayed complete restoration of production.
As recently as February 2020, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) released Alert AA20-049A describing how a post-compromise ransomware incident had affected control and communication assets on the OT network of a natural gas compression facility.
Impacts to HMIs, data historians, and polling servers resulted in loss of availability and loss of view for human operators.
