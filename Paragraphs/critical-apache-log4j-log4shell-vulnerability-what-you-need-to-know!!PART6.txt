Before Apache made the necessary update, a tweet was posted on December 9 th, insinuating that abusing JNDI Lookup in Log4j can lead to remote code execution.
This post appears to have triggered a maelstrom in both security and hacker communities.
The following day, Apache released Log4j 2.15.0 as an official fix.
Around this time, attackers started to sniff for potential victims by scanning for vulnerable machines.
On the same day, CISA released an advisory urging users and admins to upgrade Log4j to 2.15.0 as soon as possible.
The advisory was followed by an Apache Log4j Vulnerability Guidance page detailing the issue.
SANS then moved their Infocon alert to yellow for the first time since the infamous WannaCry outbreak in 2017.
Infocon alerts intend to reflect changes in malicious traffic and the possibility of disrupted connectivity and apply to the condition of the Internet infrastructure.
Infocon has only previously been elevated to yellow status for severe incidents, such as Heartbleed and Shellshock (both in 2014), which signifies the severity of Log4Shell.
The situation worsened on December 14 th , when Apache released Log4j 2.16.0 due to an insufficient fix in the previous release.
