Security researchers have also seen destructive features used as anti-forensic techniques:
The OlympicDestroyer malware targeted the Olympic Games organization and erased event logs and backups to avoid investigation.
Artificial intelligence the next weapon In recent years, we have seen malware using evasion techniques to bypass machine learning engines.
For example, in 2017 the Cerber ransomware dropped legitimate files on systems to trick the engine that classifies files.
In 2018, PyLocky ransomware used InnoSetup to package the malware and avoid machine learning detection.
Clearly, bypassing artificial intelligence engines is already on the criminal to-do list; however, criminals can also implement artificial intelligence in their malicious software.
We expect evasion techniques to begin leveraging artificial intelligence to automate target selection, or to check infected environments before deploying later stages and avoiding detection.
