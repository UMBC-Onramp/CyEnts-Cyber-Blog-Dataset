SUMMARY:
MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value (/home/dan/uni/a.out+0x496db8)
Exiting Figure 1: MemorySanitizer detection of uninitialized memory Similarly, Valgrind can also be used to detect uninitialized memory during run-time.
Detecting Uninitialized Memory in Windows Compared to Linux, Windows lacks any built-in mechanism for detecting uninitialized memory usage.
While Visual Studio and Clang-cl recently introduced AddressSanitizer support , MemorySanitizer and other sanitizers are not implemented as of this writing.
