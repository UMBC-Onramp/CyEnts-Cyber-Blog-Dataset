This means the index process will crack open the files and index their content, including some strings present in these documents.
Let’s keep that in mind for later as we continue.
Using this knowledge, we wanted to try to access the same menu that you would see when using a Cortana search on an unlocked device.
This will come as a surprise and lies at the core of all the issues we found, but simply typing while Cortana starts to listen to a query on a locked device will bring up a Windows contextual menu, as shown below:
On top: the result of typing “pas” in the Cortana search field on an unlocked computer.
Above: the result of asking “Hey Cortana, P A S” and using a whitespace keyboard sequence.
In the preceding example, we queried Cortana for the term pas, no preamble to the question, just speaking the three letters, P. A. S. Why not “pass”?
Because Cortana can be quite picky with verbal statements and there is no dictionary definition for “pass,” leading to Cortana inviting us to continue in Edge after unlocking the device.
Alternatively, instead of issuing a verbal statement, we could click on the “tap and say” button and just start typing this text, for example.
