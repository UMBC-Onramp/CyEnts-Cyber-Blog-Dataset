Network Connections The rootkit is capable of hiding TCP connections from tools such as netstat.
Much of the code for this part seems to be copied from an open-source project .
The rootkit attaches to nsiproxy.sys â€™s device stack and intercepts IOCTLs of type IOCTL_NSI_GETALLPARAM ( 0x12000B ) that are sent to it.
This IOCTL is used to retrieve information about the active network connections on the system.
When it is intercepted, the driver replaces the IoCompletion routine with a function that filters the results to hide its own network connections.
IOCTL_NSI_GETALLPARAM returns the information about network connections in an NSI_PARAM structure.
