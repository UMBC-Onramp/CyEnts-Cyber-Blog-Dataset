Once a CVE ID is released, cybercriminals can take as little as a few weeks (or in some cases days) to integrate it into their exploit kit.
For example, CVE-2018-8174 was initially reported to Microsoft in late April by two teams of threat researchers who had observed its exploitation in the wild.
Microsoft published an advisory within a week, in early May.
Meanwhile, the researchers published their security analysis of the exploit.
Only two weeks later a proof-of-concept exploit was publicly released .
In the next couple of weeks exploit kits RIG and Magnitude integrated their weaponized versions of the exploit.
