In some ways, FIN11 is reminiscent of APT1; they are notable not for their sophistication, but for their sheer volume of activity.
There are significant gaps in FIN11â€™s phishing operations, but when active, the group conducts up to five high-volume campaigns a week.
While many financially motivated threat groups are short lived, FIN11 has been conducting these widespread phishing campaigns since at least 2016.
From 2017 through 2018, the threat group primarily targeted organizations in the financial, retail, and hospitality sectors.
