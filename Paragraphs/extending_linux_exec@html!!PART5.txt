The stated goals of the IMA subsystem are “to detect if files have been accidentally or maliciously altered, both remotely and locally, appraise a file’s measurement against a ‘good’ value stored as an extended attribute, and enforce local file integrity.”
To achieve these goals, IMA provides several functions, including: Collect – “measure” a file before it is accessed.
The term measurement in this context means to grab a hash of the file data, the hash of some file metadata and the file path, and then store this data in a runtime measurement list.
Store – add the measurement to a kernel resident list and, if a hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is present, extend the IMA Platform Configuration Register (PCR).
TPM and PCR are part of an international standard for dedicated microcontrollers intended to secure hardware.
Attest – if present, use the TPM to sign the IMA PCR value to allow a remote validation of the measurement list.
Appraise – enforce local validation of a measurement against a “good” value stored in an extended attribute of the file.
Protect – protect a file’s security extended attributes (including appraisal hash) against off-line attack.
