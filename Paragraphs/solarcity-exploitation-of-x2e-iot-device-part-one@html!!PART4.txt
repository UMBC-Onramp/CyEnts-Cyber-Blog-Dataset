Technical Analysis Device Overview Before diving into the details, we’ll discuss the ConnectPort X2e device (referred to as X2e device throughout the post) at a high level.
The X2e device is a programmable gateway that connects to and collects data from ZigBee devices.
It is commonly used as a Smart Energy gateway to interpret and send energy readings from a residential Solar Inverter.
Vendors will often purchase an X2e device and configure it to read power consumption generated by a customer’s Solar Inverter.
Figure 1 outlines a typical residential solar installation and highlights the X2e’s role.
