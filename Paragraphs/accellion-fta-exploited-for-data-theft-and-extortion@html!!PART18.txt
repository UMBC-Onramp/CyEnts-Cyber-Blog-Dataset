Many of the organizations compromised by UNC2546 were previously targeted by FIN11.
An IP address that communicated with a DEWMODE web shell was in the \"Fortunix Networks L.P.\" netblock, a network frequently used by FIN11 to host download and FRIENDSPEAK command and control (C2) domains.
Implications
The overlaps between FIN11, UNC2546, and UNC2582 are compelling, but we continue to track these clusters separately while we evaluate the nature of their relationships.
One of the specific challenges is that the scope of the overlaps with FIN11 is limited to the later stages of the attack life cycle.
