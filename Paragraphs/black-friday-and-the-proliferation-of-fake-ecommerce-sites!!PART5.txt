What caught our eye immediately (besides the misspelled domain name) was the very low price on the “2696-26 M18 LITHIUM-ION CORDLESS 6-TOOL COMBO KIT” for $99.00.
Except for discontinued models/lines, such greatly reduced prices (this kit normally sells for $659) is oftentimes the hallmark of a scam.
However, to the untrained eye—the limited time offer via the countdown timer, the professional look and feel of the site—will likely catch the attention of an impulse buyer.
