Each time Emotet needs to call an API, it calls a local function to obtain it in the EAX register and then calls it.
Figure 4.2 is an example of calling API GetCommandLineW(), where 0xB03E1C69 is the hash code of module “kernel32” and 0x4543B55E is the hash code of “GetCommandLineW”.
Communicating with the C2 Server Once Emotet finishes collecting the basic information from the victim’s device, it calls the API BCryptEncrypt() to encrypt the data.
Let’s look at the kind of data contained in the collected data, as shown in Figure 5.1.
The 60H bytes data in memory is the plaintext data to be encrypted.
Let me explain what most of the data is.
0x20 , at offset+4, is the size of sha256 hash code followed, which includes the bytes starting from offset+8 to offset+0x27 (A0 C9 … 68 F8).
