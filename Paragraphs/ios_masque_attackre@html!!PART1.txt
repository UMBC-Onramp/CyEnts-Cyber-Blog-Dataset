In November of last year, we uncovered a major flaw in iOS we dubbed “ Masque Attack ” that allowed for malicious apps to replace existing, legitimate ones on an iOS device via SMS, email, or web browsing.
In total, we have notified Apple of five security issues related to four kinds of Masque Attacks.
Today, we are sharing Masque Attack II in the series – part of which has been fixed in the recent iOS 8.1.3 security content update [2].
Masque Attack II includes bypassing iOS prompt for trust and iOS URL scheme hijacking.
iOS 8.1.3 fixed the first part whereas the iOS URL scheme hijacking is still present.
