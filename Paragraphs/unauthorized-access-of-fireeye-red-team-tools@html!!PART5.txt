Detections to Help the Community To empower the community to detect these tools, we are publishing countermeasures to help organizations identify these tools if they appear in the wild.
In response to the theft of our Red Team tools, we have released hundreds of countermeasures for publicly available technologies like OpenIOC, Yara, Snort, and ClamAV.
A list of the countermeasure is available on the FireEye GitHub repository found here .
We are releasing detections and will continue to update the public repository with overlapping countermeasures for host, network, and file-based indicators as we develop new or refine existing detections.
In addition, we are publishing a list of CVEs that need to be addressed to limit the effectiveness of the Red Team tools on the GitHub page.
