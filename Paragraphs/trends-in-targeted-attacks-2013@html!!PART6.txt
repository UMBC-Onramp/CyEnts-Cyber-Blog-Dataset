And this year quite a number of zero-days were used in targeted attacks.
Exploits Quite a few zero-day exploits appeared in the wild this year, including eleven discovered by FireEye.
These exploits included techniques to bypass ASLR and application sandboxes.
The exploits that I consider the most significant are the following: CVE-2013-0640 , which was used in the MiniDuke attacks, CVE-2013-1347 , which was used in a watering hole attack on the Department of Labor website, CVE-2013-3893 , which was deployed by the same group, DeputyDog, which compromised Bit9 earlier in the year, CVE-2013-3906 , which was used in both targeted attacks and in cybercrime campaigns DeputyDog in a watering hole attack.
Evasion
The malware samples used by several advanced persistent threat (APT) actors were slightly modified this year, possibly as an evasive response to increased scrutiny, in order to avoid detection.
