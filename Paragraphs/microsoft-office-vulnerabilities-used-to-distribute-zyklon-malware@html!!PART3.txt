The document files exploit at least three known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office, which we discuss in the Infection Techniques section.
Upon execution in a vulnerable environment, the PowerShell based payload takes over.
The PowerShell script is responsible for downloading the final payload from C2 server to execute it.
A visual representation of the attack flow and execution chain can be seen in Figure 2.

This vulnerability was discovered by FireEye in September 2017, and it is a vulnerability we have observed being exploited in the wild.
The DOC file contains an embedded OLE Object that, upon execution, triggers the download of an additional DOC file from the stored URL (seen in Figure 3).
