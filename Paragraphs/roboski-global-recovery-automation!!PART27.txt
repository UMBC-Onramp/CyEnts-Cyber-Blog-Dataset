Notably, all the payloads fell into a category of commodity malware such as information stealers or commercial RATs.
An Ever-Evolving Commodity Malware Scene
Malware distribution is a continually evolving practice undertaken by potential botnet herders and spam distributors alike, constantly on the quest to bypass organizational security controls to deliver malware.
As part of that ecosystem, commodity packers, such as RoboSki, are used extensively to spread numerous types of malicious code.
Keeping up to date about new variations, IOCs and overall delivery TTPs are essential to keeping networks free of malware that could eventually result in more advanced compromises.
To avoid the associated risks that come with a reliance on digital exchange for operations, the use of automation to rapidly generate indicators can help equip net defenders with the necessary insight to identify and prevent compromise.
X-Force and CT analysts assess with high confidence that the use of ordering- and logistics-themed phishing emails will persist, especially as global trade continues to recover.
Organizations especially engaged in the import and export of items worldwide should exercise extreme caution and harden their network environments.
