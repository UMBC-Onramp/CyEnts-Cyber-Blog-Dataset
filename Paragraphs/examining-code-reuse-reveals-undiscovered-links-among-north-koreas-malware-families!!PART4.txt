With targeted campaigns, an adversary must keep its tools undetected for as long as possible.
By identifying reused code, we gain valuable insights about the “ancestral relations” to known threat actors or other campaigns.
Our research was heavily focused on this type of analysis.
In our years of investigating cyber threats, we have seen the DPRK conduct multiple cyber campaigns.
In North Korea, hackers’ skills determine which cyber units they work for.
We are aware two major focuses of DPRK campaigns: one to raise money, and one to pursue nationalist aims.
The first workforce gathers money for the nation, even if that means committing cybercrime to hack into financial institutions, hijack gambling sessions, or sell pirated and cracked software.
Unit 180 is responsible for illegally gaining foreign currency using hacking techniques.
The second workforce operates larger campaigns motivated by nationalism, gathering intelligence from other nations, and in some cases disrupting rival states and military targets.
