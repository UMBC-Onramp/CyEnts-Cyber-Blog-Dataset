Apple’s AirTags cost a fair amount of money, a person doing the tracking needs to pair an AirTag with their real account, and the manufacturer is actually trying to make it harder to hide the tags.
In contrast, developers of spyware and stalkerware apps are doing their best to make them as undetectable as possible.
In addition to tracking location, tracking apps give the spy a heap of other options.
In particular, they open access to the victim’s documents, photos and messages, which can be even more dangerous than geolocation.
So if you’re worried about being tracked, the first thing you need to do is protect your smartphone — it’s the most obvious target .
Then you can look around for unknown AirTags.
If you use an iPhone, it will notify you pretty quickly that there’s a tag.
If you have an Android and you want to protect yourself from being tracked with an AirTag, install the Apple Tracker Detect app.
