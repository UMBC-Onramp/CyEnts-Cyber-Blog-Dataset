Analysis of Attacker Intent We assess with moderate confidence that the attackerâ€™s long-term objective was to develop the capability to cause a physical consequence.
We base this on the fact that the attacker initially obtained a reliable foothold on the DCS and could have developed the capability to manipulate the process or shutdown the plant, but instead proceeded to compromise the SIS system.
