A tracker\nobject is created from the Vivisect workspace, and then we get all\ncross-references to the string decoder function ( decStringFunc ).
Figure 5:
Argtracker initialization Figure 6 shows the call to getPushArgs() for every reference to the decoder function.
Only two arguments are\npassed on the stack so the second argument is 2.
Because registers are\nused to pass parameters, we now need to use the third argument to getPushArgs() by passing in a list of\nregister names that contain arguments to extract: [ ‘eax’, ‘ecx’, ‘edi’ ].
