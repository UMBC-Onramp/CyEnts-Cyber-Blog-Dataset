Right-clicking in a highlighted isolated subgraph node and selecting \"SimplifyGraph ->
Create isolated subgraph\".
Doing either of these prompts you for text for the new graph node to create.
If you manually create/delete groups using IDA you may need to refresh the chooser's knowledge of the current function groups (right-click and select \"Refresh groups\" in the chooser).
You can right click in the chooser and select \"Clear highlights\" to remove the current highlights.
As you navigate to new functions the chooser updates to show isolated subgraphs in the current function.
Closing the chooser removes any active highlights.
Any custom colors you applied prior to running the plug-in are preserved and reapplied when the current highlights are removed.
Isolated subgraph calculations operates on the original control flow graph, so isolated subgroups can't be nested.
