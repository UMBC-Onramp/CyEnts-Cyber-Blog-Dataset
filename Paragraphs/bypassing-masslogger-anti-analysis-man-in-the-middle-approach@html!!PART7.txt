Figure 3: dnSpy IL view showing the method's details Method 0x0600049D control flow has been obfuscated into a series of switch statements.
We can still somewhat follow the methodâ€™s high-level logic with the help of dnSpy as a debugger.
However, fully analyzing the method would be very time consuming.
Instead, when first analyzing this payload, I chose to quickly scan over the entire module to look for hints.
Luckily, I spot a few interesting strings I missed during basic static analysis: clrjit.dll , VirtualAlloc , VirtualProtect and WriteProcessMemory as seen in Figure 4.
