This variant inserts a check against the backdoor password after the bind routine so that the return value can be conditionally stomped to spoof successful authentication.
Figure 1: LDAP Auth Bypass RADIUS Two Factor Auth Bypass The routine DSAuth::RadiusAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword begins the RADIUS-2FA authentication procedure.
This variant inserts checks against the backdoor password after the RADIUS authentication packet is received back from the authentication server.
If the backdoor password is provided by the attacker, the packet type and successful authentication status flags are overwritten to spoof successful authentication.
Figure 2: Radius-2FA Bypass SLOWPULSE Variant 2 ACE Two Factor Auth Credential Logging This variant logs credentials used during the ACE-2FA authentication procedure DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword .
Rather than bypassing authentication, this variant logs the username and password to a file for later use by the attacker.
Figure 3:
ACE Auth Credential Log SLOWPULSE Variant 3 ACE Two Factor Auth Bypass This variant is responsible for bypassing the ACE-2FA logon procedure starting with DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword .
The flow of the authentication procedure is modified to bypass the routine responsible for verifying the username and password if the backdoor password is provided.
