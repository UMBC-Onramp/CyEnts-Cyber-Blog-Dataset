Kamilló Matek discusses the full details of this vulnerability in this article .
In summary, a vulnerable host parameter allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands in the target device.
In this case, it is being exploited to force vulnerable devices to download and execute a malicious script, tshit.sh , which then downloads the main binary payloads, as discussed in the next section.
To accomplish this, the following requests are sent to the device: Request 1: Request 2: It is important to emphasize that this exploitation requires authentication to succeed.
Therefore, it is crucial for users to change their default credentials.
Same Package As with Mirai’s normal infection routine, the executed shell script downloads the main payload binaries for different architectures and platforms and executes them blindly in the victim’s system.
In addition, it prevents other botnets from taking over the device by blocking connections to commonly targeted ports.
