In a recent collaboration to investigate a rise in malware infections featuring a commercial remote access trojan (RAT), IBM Security X-Force and Cipher Tech Solutions (CT), a defense and intelligence security firm, investigated malicious activity that spiked in the first quarter of 2021.
With over 1,300 malware samples collected, the teams analyzed the delivery of a new variant of the RoboSki packer, which is widely used to thwart detection and deliver commodity RATs to enterprise networks.
CT automated the capability to rapidly extract configuration data from malware to produce actionable indicators of compromise (IOCs).
Analysts tested the ability to statically extract configuration data, bypassing dynamic anti-analysis features using data processed by CT , discovering approximately 1,300 additional samples.
The RoboSki-packed malware samples feature new capabilities, such as the ability to load resources and convert pixelated data to RGB order, resulting in the RoboSki component, and decoding and decrypting a ReZer0 loader.
The ReZer0 loader can embed malware or fetch it from remote servers and is known for its ability to deliver encrypted payloads and anti-sandbox checks.
Layering loaders is a tactic many malware distributors use to evade anti-virus detection and security scanners.
