To this day, two main attack vectors make up all previously disclosed attacks against the iOS platform: 1.
     Jailbroken iOS devices that allow unsigned or ill-signed apps to be installed due to the disabled signature checking function.
In some cases, the sandbox restrictions are lifted, which allows apps to function outside of the sandbox. 2.
     App sideloading via Enterprise Certifications on non-jailbroken devices.
FireEye published a series of reports that detailed attacks exploiting this attack surface, and recent reports show a continued focus on this known attack vector.
