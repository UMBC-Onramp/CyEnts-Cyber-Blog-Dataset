Example Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values Domain Masquerading APT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies and Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training, maintenance and support for Saudi’s military and commercial fleet.
Based on observed targeting patterns, APT33 likely used these domains in spear phishing emails to target victim organizations.
The following domains masquerade as these organizations: Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company, Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia (NGAAKSA), and Vinnell Arabia.

alsalam.ddns[.]net ngaaksa.ddns[.]net ngaaksa.sytes[.]net vinnellarabia.myftp[.]org Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft company, and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries entered into a joint venture to create the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Center in Saudi Arabia in 2015 with the goal of servicing Saudi Arabia’s rotorcraft fleet and building a self-sustaining workforce in the Saudi aerospace supply base.
Alsalam Aircraft Company also offers military and commercial maintenance, technical support, and interior design and refurbishment services.
