To weaponize this, we can use symbolic links to point the /WEB/python/.ssh/ to other areas of the filesystem and coerce the root process into chown â€™ing these files to be owned by the python user.
The process we took to exploit this was as follows:
Authenticate over SSH using hardcoded python user credentials.
Create a symbolic link, /WEB/
python/.ssh , that points to /etc/init.d/ .
Reboot the X2e, forcing the system to re-execute /etc/init.d/S50dropbear.sh .
