Operators probing for GPU info and sorting bots into #nvidia channel After sorting machines based on their mining capabilities, the operators would go on to download and execute a new ShellBot Perl script on those machines.
The ‘pola’ version contained new IRC parameters, forcing the bots to join a different IRC server, which appeared like the operators were migrating active bots to a different network.

The operation X-Force tracked was probably rather fresh.
When the researchers followed the migrated bots to the Pola server, they noticed that it was created that very same day.
It already contained 143 bots, which were most likely migrated from other channels.
Within the next day, the number of bots doubled, suggesting that there must have been additional servers like Blackcat moving higher value bots to the Pola server.
Once on the Pola server, the filtering for higher value bots continued and a third payload — miner3.tgz — was deployed to the selected bots in a series of commands launched by the botnet’s operators.
