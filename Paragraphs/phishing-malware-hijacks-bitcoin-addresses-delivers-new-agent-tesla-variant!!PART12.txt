According to Figure 5.1, below, we can see that this new variant is fully obfuscated, meaning it is able to protect its code from being easily analyzed by security researchers.
The class names, function names, and variable names are meaningless, as shown in Figure 5.1 (such as “A”, “a”, “B”, “b”, “C”, “c” and so on.)
For instance, the entry point function of this variant is this— “A.b.
A()”.
