Each block is cryptographically hashed, and must include the hash of the previous block, thus forming the \"chain\" in blockchain.
In order for miners to compute the complex hashing of each valid block, they must use a machine's computational resources.
The more blocks that are mined, the more resource-intensive solving the hash becomes.
To overcome this, and accelerate the mining process, many miners will join collections of computers called \"pools\" that work together to calculate the block hashes.
