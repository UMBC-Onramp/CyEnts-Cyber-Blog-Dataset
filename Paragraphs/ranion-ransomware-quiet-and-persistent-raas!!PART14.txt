The 2017 Ranion variant analyzed below was “protected” by the Confuser project.
The following 2021 variant of Ranion was “protected” using the ConfuserEx project.

Conclusion - Ranion Ransomware HiddenTear-based Ranion is a low-profile, low-cost RaaS that has not achieved the same success of other, more notorious ransomware gangs.
