One method that does not require extensive shellcode is to use a “return to libc” attack to execute the system command.
Because the system call typically takes a string as a parameter, this might pass through the filter.
Because the Wemo does not use address space layout randomization, if we use ROP it would be theoretically possible to make a call to system without needing to pass additional shellcode through the XML filter.
