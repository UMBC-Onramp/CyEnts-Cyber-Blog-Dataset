But AI was still the domain of science fiction (and, of course, 22 years later, we are still only at the beginning stages of AI).
But that doesn’t mean that botnets weren’t a problem.
Simply put, a botnet is a group of compromised computers under the command and control of an operator.
Back then, botnets were simple.
They infected and spread between machines, with most botnet malware connecting to a predetermined command and control server (C2) on Internet Relay Chat (IRC—think of old AOL chatrooms) to receive instructions.
The first observed botnet was the EarthLink Spam botnet, which made its debut in 2000.
It had a simple task: to send out massive quantities of spam.
