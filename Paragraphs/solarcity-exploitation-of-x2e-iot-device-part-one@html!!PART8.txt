Figure 4 shows the mapped-out components as well as a cluster of pins that resembled a typical 3-pin universal asynchronous transmit/receive (UART) connection, a common debugging interface on embedded devices.
Figure 4: X2e components and suspicious cluster of pins Without a remote connection to the X2e device, UART is an attractive target.
UART typically provides the equivalent functionality of a service like SSH or Telnet and the added benefit of watching verbose output during system boot.
