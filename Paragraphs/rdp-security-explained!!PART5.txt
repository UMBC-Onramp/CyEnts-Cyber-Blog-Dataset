Do not allow RDP connections over the open Internet To be very clear… RDP should never be open to the Internet.
The internet is continuously being scanned for open port 3389 (the default RDP port).
Even with a complex password policy and multi-factor authentication you can be vulnerable to denial of service and user account lockout.
A much safer alternative is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
A VPN will allow a remote user to securely access their corporate network without exposing their computer to the entire Internet.
The connection is mutually encrypted, providing authentication for both client and server, preferably using a dual factor, while creating a secure tunnel to the corporate network.
