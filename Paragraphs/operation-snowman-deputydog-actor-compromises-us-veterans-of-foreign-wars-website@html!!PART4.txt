For example, the attacker corrupts a Flash Vector object and then accesses the corrupted object from within Flash to access memory.
We have discussed this technique and other ASLR bypass approaches in our blog .
One minor difference between the previous approaches and this attack is the heap spray address, which was changed to 0x1a1b2000 in this exploit.
Code execution
Once the attackerâ€™s code has full memory access through the corrupted Flash Vector object, the code searches through loaded libraries gadgets by machine code.
The attacker then overwrites the vftable pointer of a flash.
Media.
Sound() object in memory to point to the pivot and begin ROP.
After successful exploitation, the code repairs the corrupted Flash Vector and flash.
Media.
Sound to continue execution.
