IBM Security X-Force researchers studied the botnet activity of a malware variant that is used by cyber crime groups to illegally mine cryptocurrency.
Examining two ShellBot botnets that appeared in attacks honeypots caught, the X-Force team was able to infect its own devices and become part of the live botnets, thereby gaining insight into how these botnets were managed internally.
This post provides the details on IBMâ€™s research and sheds light on the growing threat of cryptomining botnets to enterprise networks.
While seeing computational resources abused by cryptojacking operations is enough of a problem, the riskier consequence of the infection is that malware begets malware.
