It was released in 2007 and includes a built-in Win32 environment that allows shellcodes to resolve API at runtime.
The library also provides end users with a convenient way to receive callbacks when API functions are hit.
The original project supported 5 Windows dlls, 51 hooks and 234 opcodes all wrapped in a tight 1mb package.
Unfortunately it is no longer being updated.
In late 2015, we saw the Unicorn engine project released by Nguyen Anh Quynh and Dang Hoang Vu.
This project takes the processor emulators from QEMU and wraps them into an easy to use library.
Unicorn, however, does not provide a Win32 layer.
