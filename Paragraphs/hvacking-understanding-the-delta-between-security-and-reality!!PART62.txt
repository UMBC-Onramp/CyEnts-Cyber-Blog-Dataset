If they have, the hook function replaces the correct state, stored in canioWriteOutput’s second parameter, with the state asserted by the attacker before calling the real canioWriteOutput function.
Otherwise, the hook function acts as a simple passthrough for the real deal.
A positive side effect of this, from the attacker’s perspective, is the touchscreen will show the output as the state the user last requested even after the malware has modified it.
Implementing this simple state-tracking resolved our prior issue of the attacker-asserted state not persisting.
With control of the binary output, we moved on to looking at each of the other types of inputs and outputs that can be connected to the modules.
We used a similar approach in identifying the methods used to read or write data from the modules and then hooking them.
