Log4j 2.x mitigation
Implement one of the following mitigation techniques:
Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.16.0.
Java 7 users should upgrade to release 2.12.2.
Otherwise, in any release other than 2.16.0, you may remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class Users are advised not to enable JNDI in Log4j 2.16.0.
If the JMS Appender is required, use Log4j 2.12.2.
Note that this vulnerability impacts only the log4j-core JAR file.
