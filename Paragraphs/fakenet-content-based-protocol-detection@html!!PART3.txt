The Diverter also redirected packets based on whether FakeNet-NG was run in Single-Host or Multi-Host mode, and if any applications were blacklisted or whitelisted according to the configuration.
It would simply release the packet on the appropriate port and the intended Listener would receive it on the socket.
New Design My challenge was to eliminate this port/protocol dependency.
In order to disassociate the Listeners from the corresponding ports, a new architecture was needed.
