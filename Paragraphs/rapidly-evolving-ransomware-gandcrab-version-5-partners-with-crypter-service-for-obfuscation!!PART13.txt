The dynamic call to IsWoW64Process with obfuscated strings.
Depending on the result, the malware has two embedded DLLs, encrypted with a simple operation XOR 0x18.
Decrypting the DLL to load with the exploit and fix the header.
The malware authors use a clever trick with fuzzing to avoid detection: The first two bytes of the DLL are trash, something that is later fixed, as we see in the preceding image.
After decryption and loading the exploit, this DLL creates a mutex in the system and some pipes to communicate with the main malware.
