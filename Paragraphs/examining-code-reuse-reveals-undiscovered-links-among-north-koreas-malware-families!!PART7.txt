The following graph presents a high-level overview of these relations.
Each node represents a malware family or a hacking tool (“Brambul,” “Fallchill,” etc.)
and each line presents a code similarity between two families.
A thicker line correlates to a stronger similarity.
In defining similarities, we take into account only unique code connections, and disregard common code or libraries.
This definition holds both for this graph and our entire research.
Figure 3:
Code similarities between North Korean–associated malware families.
We can easily see a significant amount of code similarities between almost every one of the attacks associated with North Korea.
Our research included thousands of samples, mostly unclassified or uncategorized.
This graph was plotted using a data set of only several hundred samples, so there might be more connections than displayed here.
