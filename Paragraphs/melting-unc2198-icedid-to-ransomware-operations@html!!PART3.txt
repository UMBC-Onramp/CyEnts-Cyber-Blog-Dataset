Between July and December 2020, an ICEDID phishing infection chain consisted of a multi-stage process involving MOUSEISLAND and PHOTOLOADER (Figure 1).
Figure 1:
Example UNC2420 MOUSEISLAND to ICEDID Infection Chain MOUSEISLAND is a Microsoft Word macro downloader used as the first infection stage and is delivered inside a password-protected zip attached to a phishing email (Figure 2).
Based on our intrusion data from responding to ICEDID related incidents, the secondary payload delivered by MOUSEISLAND has been PHOTOLOADER, which acts as an intermediary downloader to install ICEDID.
Mandiant attributes the MOUSEISLAND distribution of PHOTOLOADER and other payloads to UNC2420 , a distribution threat cluster created by Mandiant’s Threat Pursuit team.
UNC2420 activity shares overlaps with the publicly reported nomenclature of “ Shathak ” or “ TA551 ”.

Although analysis is always ongoing, at the time of publishing this blog post, Mandiant tracks multiple distinct threat clusters (UNC groups) of various sizes that have used ICEDID as a foothold to enable intrusion operations.
The most prominent of these threat clusters is UNC2198 , a group that has targeted organizations in North America across a breadth of industries.
