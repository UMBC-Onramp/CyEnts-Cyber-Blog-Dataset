SMOKEDHAM created a persistence mechanism for NGROK by adding VirtualHost.vbs to the WindNT value under the current users Run registry key.
reg.exe add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v WindNT /d
C:\\ProgramData\\WindNT\\VirtualHost.vbs Keylogger Deployment This attacker utilized an additional keylogging utility named C:\\ProgramData\\psh\\console.exe.
The keylogging utility was configured to capture and record keystrokes to C:\\ProgramData\\psh\\System32Log.txt.
Mandiant then observed the attacker use UltraVNC to download two LNK files that reference the keylogging utility.
The downloaded files were named desktop.lnk and console.lnk, respectively, and were placed in the following persistence locations: C:\\Users\\[username]\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\desktop.lnk %
APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start
Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\desktop.lnk %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\console.lnk
Cobalt Strike
Beacon The attacker used UltraVNC to download an in-memory dropper for Cobalt Strike to C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco Systems\\Cisco Jabber\\update.exe.
Update.exe was a Go based dropper created using the ScareCrow framework.
The attacker executed C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco Systems\\Cisco Jabber\\update.exe using Command Prompt.
cmd.exe /c '
C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco Systems\\Cisco Jabber\\update.exe'&&exit
The execution of ScareCrow framework dropper C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco
Systems\\Cisco Jabber\\update.exe resulted in the creation of a Cobalt Strike stageless payload to C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco\\update.exe, which then established a connection to a Cobalt Strike Beacon server located at w2doger[.]xyz when executed.
Mandiant observed the attacker using UltraVNC to download and store a file named update.lnk in the %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\ directory.
Mandiant was not able to recover update.lnk at the time of writing, but suspects that this file was created to add persistence to the Cobalt Strike stageless payload.
