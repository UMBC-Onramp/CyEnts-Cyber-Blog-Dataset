Conclusion When we started our journey with GandCrab we did not expect it would take us so far down the rabbit hole.
Mass sample analysis and searching for administration indicators provided a way to get more insight in a multi-million-dollar criminal enterprise, determine key players and foresee future events through changes in the business structure.
We believe that the retirement of GandCrab was not an overnight decision and, based on the data on the affiliates, it was clear that something was going to happen.
With the emergence of Sodinokibi and the few forum postings by a high profile former GandCrab affiliate, everything fell into place.
We have strong indications that some of the top affiliates have found a new home with Sodinokibi to further their criminal business.
Given that the income of the RaaS network is largely dependent on the performance of its top affiliates, and it is run like a normal business, we (the security industry) should not only research the products the criminals develop, but also identify possible ways to successfully disrupt the criminal business.
In our next episode we dive deeper into the financial streams involved in the affiliate program and provide an estimate of how much money these actors are earning with the ransomware-as-a-service business model.
