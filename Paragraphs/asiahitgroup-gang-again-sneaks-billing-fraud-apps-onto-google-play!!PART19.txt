We expect that cybercriminals will continue to develop and distribute new billing fraud campaigns to target more countries and affect more users around the world.
Cybercriminals always follow the money, and one of the most effective ways to steal money from users is via billing fraud.
A victim will likely not notice a fraudulent charge, for example, until it appears on the mobile bill at the end of the month.
Even when the payment is detected early, most of the time the charge is for a subscription rather than a one-time payment.
