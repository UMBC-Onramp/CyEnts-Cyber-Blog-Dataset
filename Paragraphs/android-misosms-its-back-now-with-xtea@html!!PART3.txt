The new MisoSMS also uses a variant of the XTEA encryption algorithm to communicate with its CnC server.
The request and responses of the CnC server are structured so that the first four bytes of the request and response contain the length of the encrypted blob of data.
By skipping the first four bytes, we can decrypt the communications using the key embedded in the native binary.
