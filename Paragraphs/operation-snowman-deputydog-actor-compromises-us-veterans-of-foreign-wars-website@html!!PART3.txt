The vulnerability allows the attacker to modify one byte of memory at an arbitrary address.
The attacker uses the vulnerability to do the following: Gain access to memory from Flash ActionScript, bypassing address space layout randomization (ASLR) Pivot to a return-oriented programing (ROP) exploit technique to bypass data execution prevention (DEP) EMET detection The attacker uses the Microsoft.
XMLDOM ActiveX control to load a one-line XML string containing a file path to the EMET DLL.
Then the exploit code parses the error resulting from the XML load order to determine whether the load failed because the EMET DLL is not present.
Â  
The exploit proceeds only if this check determines that the EMET DLL is not present.
ASLR bypass Because the vulnerability allows attackers to modify memory to an arbitrary address, the attacker can use it to bypass ASLR.
