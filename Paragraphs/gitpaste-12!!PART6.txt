But unfortunately for this threat actor, this implementation does not do what they expect it to do.
Worming Capability The Gitpaste-12 malware also contains a script that launches attacks against other machines, in an attempt to replicate and spread.
It chooses a random /8
CIDR for attack and will try all addresses within that range, as demonstrated by this call: while true;do awk -va=\\$((\\$RANDOM%128))
‘BEGIN{for(b=0;256>b;b++)
for(c=0;256>c;c++) for(d=0;256
>d;d++) system(\\”./sh \\”a\\”.\\”d\\”.\\”c\\”.\\”b\\”
And here we can see the worm attempting to spread: Another version of the script also opens ports 30004 and 30005 for reverse shell commands: Gitpaste-12 Exploits Gitpaste-12 uses 11 vulnerabilities and a telnet brute forcer to spread.
