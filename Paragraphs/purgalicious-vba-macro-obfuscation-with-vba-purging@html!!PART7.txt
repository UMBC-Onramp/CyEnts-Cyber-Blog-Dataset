OfficePurge supports Microsoft Office Word, Excel and\nPublisher documents that follow the CFBF file format.
In the following\nexamples, we used OfficePurge and a VBA payload from the public\ntoolkit Unicorn to\ntest the effectiveness of VBA purging a Microsoft Office Word document\nthat contained a Base64 encoded PowerShell payload (Figure 3).
Figure 3:
Macro payload generated with Unicorn The strings output (Figure 4) for the original Word document shows\nUnicorn’s Base64 encoded PowerShell payload, which is detected by many\nsecurity products.
On the other hand, the output for the VBA purged\ndocument does not fully show the Base64 encoded payload because the PerformanceCache is removed.
The CompressedSourceCode still contains the Base64\nencoded payload, but Microsoft’s custom compression algorithm splits\nthe strings, making it harder for static analysis to detect it.
