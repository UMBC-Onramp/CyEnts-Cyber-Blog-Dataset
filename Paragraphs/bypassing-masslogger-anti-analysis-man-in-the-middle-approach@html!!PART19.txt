However, due to the unique way MassLogger hooks compileMethod() , we cannot use the vtable hooking technique implemented by many of the aforementioned projects.
Therefore, Iâ€™d like to share the following project: JITM , which is designed use inline hooking implemented by PolyHook library.
JITM comes with a wrapper for compileMethod() which logs all the method body headers and MSIL bytes to a JSON file before calling the original compileMethod() .
