“N” is for normalized, which means dividing DCG scores by ideal DCG scores calculated for a ground truth holdout dataset, which we obtain from FLARE-identified relevant strings contained within historical malware reports.
Normalization makes it possible to compare scores across samples since the number of strings within different Strings outputs can vary widely.
Figure 4: Kernel Density Estimate of NDCG@100 scores for Strings outputs from the holdout dataset.
Scores are calculated for the original ordering after simply running the Strings program on each binary (gray) versus the predicted ordering from the trained GBDT model (red).
In practice, we take the first k strings indexed by their ranks within a single Strings output, where the k parameter is chosen based on how many strings a malware analyst will attend to or deem relevant on average.
For our purposes we set k = 100 based on the approximate average number of relevant strings per Strings output.
