User authentication to Linux over UART Without any ability to interrupt the boot process or credentials to authenticate to the X2e, we were faced with another dead end.
We then shifted our analysis to obtaining the firmware stored on the X2e’s non-volatile storage.
Chip Removal and Data Extraction In this section, we’ll cover the basics of non-volatile memory, often referred to as “flash memory”, present on embedded devices as well as the process used to extract content from the chip.
