We observed UNC2630 harvesting credentials from various Pulse Secure VPN login flows, which ultimately allowed the actor to use legitimate account credentials to move laterally into the affected environments.
In order to maintain persistence to the compromised networks, the actor utilized legitimate, but modified, Pulse Secure binaries and scripts on the VPN appliance.
This was done to accomplish the following: Trojanize shared objects with malicious code to log credentials and bypass authentication flows, including multifactor authentication requirements.
We track these trojanized assemblies as SLOWPULSE and its variants.
Inject webshells we currently track as RADIALPULSE and PULSECHECK into legitimate Internet-accessible Pulse Secure VPN appliance administrative web pages for the devices.
Toggle the filesystem between Read-Only and Read-Write modes to allow for file modification on a typically Read-Only filesystem.
Maintain persistence across VPN appliance general upgrades that are performed by the administrator.
