This expands the attack surface further, to the network edge.
We expect to see even more activity targeting edge devices that had traditionally been overlooked by cybercriminals.
From Top to Bottom We expect to see new exploits targeting satellite networks over the next year.
There are a half dozen major satellite internet providers already in place.
Satellite base stations serve as the entry point to the satellite network, essentially connecting everyone, everywhere—including cybercriminals to their targets—so this is where a lot of threats will be lurking.
But there will also be millions of terminals from which to launch an attack.
We have already begun to see new threats targeting satellite-based networks, such as ICARUS, which is a proof-of-concept DDoS attack that leverages direct global accessibility to satellites to launch attacks from numerous locations.
