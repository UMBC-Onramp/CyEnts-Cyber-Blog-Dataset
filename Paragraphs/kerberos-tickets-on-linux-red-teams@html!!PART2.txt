We will also introduce a new tool that extracts Kerberos tickets from domain-joined systems that utilize the System Security Services Daemon Kerberos Cache Manager (SSSD KCM).
What is Kerberos Kerberos is a standardized authentication protocol that was originally created by MIT in the 1980s.
The protocol has evolved over time.
Today, Kerberos Version 5 is implemented by numerous products, including Microsoft Active Directory.
Â Kerberos was originally designed to mutually authenticate identities over an unsecured communication line.
The Microsoft implementation of Kerberos is used in Active Directory environments to securely authenticate users to various services, such as the domain (LDAP), database servers (MSSQL) and file shares (SMB/CIFS).
While other authentication protocols exist within Active Directory, Kerberos is one of the most popular methods.
Technical documentation on how Microsoft implemented Kerberos Protocol Extensions within Active Directory can be found in the MS-KILE standards published on MSDN.
Short Example of Kerberos Authentication in Active Directory To illustrate how Kerberos works, we have selected a common scenario where a user John Smith with the account
