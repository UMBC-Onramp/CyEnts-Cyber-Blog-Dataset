According to FortiGuard Labs , 2022 is shaping up to be a banner year for cybercriminals, with ransomware on the rise and an unprecedented number of attackers lining up to find a victim.
Attacks will continue to span the entire attack surface, leaving IT teams scrambling to cover every possible avenue of attack.
This will be incredibly challenging because the attack surface will simultaneously be expanding as organizations transition to more hybrid environments and workspaces, adopt more AI and ML-based technologies , develop new connectivity options, and deploy additional business-critical applications and devices into the cloud.
By understanding what the future may hold in relation to cyber threats, we give ourselves the best possible chance of defeating them.
Attack Framework - Left to Right Attacks are often discussed in terms of left-hand and right-hand threats when viewed through an attack chain such as the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
On the left are efforts spent pre-attack, which includes planning, development, and weaponization strategies.
We predict that cybercriminals will spend more time and effort on reconnaissance and discovering zero-day capabilities to exploit new technologies and expanding network environments.
