Figure 24 The code producing the overwrite in memory is only taken if the value in R0, when bitwise ANDed with the immediate value 3, is not equal to 0.
From our crash dump, we knew that the value in R0 is the address of the destination we want to copy to.
This potentially posed a problem.
If the address we wanted to write to was 4-byte aligned, which was highly likely, the code path for our vulnerability would not be taken.
