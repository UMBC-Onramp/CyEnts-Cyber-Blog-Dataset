Apache Log4j is part of the Apache Logging Project.
By and large, usage of this library is one of the easiest ways to log errors, and that is why most Java developers use it.
Many large software companies and online services use the Log4j library, including Amazon, Apple iCloud, Cisco, Cloudflare, ElasticSearch, Red Hat, Steam, Tesla, Twitter, and many more.
Because of the library being so popular, some information security researchers expect a significant increase in the attacks on vulnerable servers over the coming days.

Almost all versions of Log4j are vulnerable, starting from 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1.
The simplest and most effective protection method is to install the most recent version of the library, 2.15.0 .
You can download it on the project page .
If for some reason updating the library is not possible, Apache Foundation recommends using one of the mitigation methods.
