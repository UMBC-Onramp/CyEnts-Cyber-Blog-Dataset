That way it is not possible to use forensic tools to recover the files because they use the same sector on the raw disk.
The malware does not delete the file using the function “DeleteFileW” and later create a new one with the crypted data.
Instead, all changes are applied in the mapping directly, in memory, without using a file pointer on the disk to read and write, which makes the process much quicker.
The image of the file is unmapped, and handles closed.
The process is repeated with new files.
The list of folders that the malware avoids are: Windows main directory.
Games Tor Browser ProgramData cache2\\entries Low\\Content.
IE5 User Data\\Default\\Cache All Users Local Settings AppData\\Local Program Files
The malware ignores these file extensions: LNK EXE SYS DLL
The malware also has a list of filenames that will not be crypted: inf ini ini dat db bak dat.log db bin DECRYPT-FILES.txt
However, it does crypt the file “ntuser.ini” to prevent other ransomwares from crypting it.
It creates the ransom note in each folder that it can.
