 manufactured by no less than 17 vendors according to Tenable research, including some ISPs.
 The common thread between these devices seems to be firmware from Arcadyan.
CVE-2021-20090 is a path traversal vulnerability that leads to an authentication bypass.
When exploited, the attacker can take over control of the affected device.
For example, Tenable has shown how to modify the configuration to enable telnet on a vulnerable router and gain root level shell access to the device.
As of August 5, we have identified some attack patterns that attempt to exploit this vulnerability in the wild coming from an IP address located in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
The attacker seems to be attempting to deploy a Mirai variant on the affected routers using scripts similar in name to the ones mentioned by Palo Alto Networks in March.
We had witnessed the same activity starting February 18.
The similarity could indicate that the same threat actor is behind this new attack and attempting to upgrade their infiltration arsenal with yet another freshly disclosed vulnerability.
