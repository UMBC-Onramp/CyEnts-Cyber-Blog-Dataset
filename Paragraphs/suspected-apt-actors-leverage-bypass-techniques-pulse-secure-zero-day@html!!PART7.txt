Due to a lack of context and forensic evidence at this time, Mandiant cannot associate all the code families described in this report to UNC2630 or UNC2717.
We also note the possibility that one or more related groups is responsible for the development and dissemination of these different tools across loosely connected APT actors.
It is likely that additional groups beyond UNC2630 and UNC2717 have adopted one or more of these tools.
Despite these gaps in our understanding, we included detailed analysis, detection techniques, and mitigations for all code families in the Technical Annex.
