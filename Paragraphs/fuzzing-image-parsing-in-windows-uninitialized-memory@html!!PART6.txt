One of the indicators we can use to detect uninitialized memory usage, specifically in the case of image decoding, is the resulting pixels after the image is decoded.
When an image is decoded, it results in a set of raw pixels.
If image decoding uses any uninitialized memory, some or all of the pixels may end up as random.
In simpler words, decoding an image multiple times may result in different output each time if uninitialized memory is used.
