The state of these items can be tracked through either LEDs on the modules or the touchscreen interface, hence it was unnecessary for us to acquire them for testing purposes.
Despite this, it is still important to note which type of input or output each “device”, virtual or otherwise, is connected to on the modules.
Figure 27 The programming to control these devices is surprisingly simple.
Essentially, based on the inputs, an output is rendered.
Figure 28 shows the programming logic present on the device during our testing.
Figure 28
There are three user-defined software variables: “Heating System”, “Room Temp Spt”, and “Heating System Enable Spt”.
  Here, “spt” indicates a set point.
These can be defined by an operator at run time and help determine when an output should be turned on or off.
