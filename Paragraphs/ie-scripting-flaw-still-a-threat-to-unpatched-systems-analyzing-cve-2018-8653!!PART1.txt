By Philippe Laulheret and Eoin Carroll on Jan 10, 2019 Microsoft recently patched a critical flaw in Internet Explorer’s scripting engine that could lead to remote code execution.
The vulnerability is being exploited in the wild and was originally reported by a researcher from Google’s Threat Analysis Group.
Microsoft released an out-of-band patch to fix the vulnerability before the normal patch cycle.
McAfee products received an update to detect the threat shortly after the patch was released.
A remote attacker can target Internet Explorer Versions 9 through 11 via a specially crafted website, while a local attacker on a rogue network could also target the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery service, which uses the same vulnerable scripting engine (jscript.dll).
