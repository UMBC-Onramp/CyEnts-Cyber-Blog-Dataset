By going through the code, we noticed several pieces of code overlap and reuse, for example, with samples from Operation Troy.
Figure 11:
Code overlap in a Dark Hotel sample.
Identifying a group By applying what we learned from our comparisons and code-block identifications, we uncovered possible new links between malware families and the groups using them.
With the different pieces of malware we have analyzed, we can illustrate the code reuse and sharing between the groups known to be affiliated with North Korea.
