A cybersecurity researcher discovered a new category of Wi-Fi vulnerabilities recently.
But the surprising news is that this new category is actually very old.
 Called FragAttacks, these 12 Wi-Fi vulnerabilities have existed since the late 90s.
But they’re new to the cybersecurity world because people only recently discovered and described them.
Researchers unveiled the details on May 12, some nine months after discovery.
The researchers will present their work at the USENIX Security conference at Black Hat USA in late July and early August.
How Does This Vulnerability Work?
Discovered and described by Belgian security researcher, Mathy Vanhoef, these FragAttacks (short for fragmentation and aggregation attacks) affect most Wi-Fi devices shipped since the late 1990s.
Vanhoef is well known in wireless security circles because he found the KRACK Wi-Fi vulnerability about four years ago.
He believes that every Wi-Fi product features at least one of the vulnerabilities described.
The flaws affect all recent Wi-Fi security protocols, from the oldest wired equivalent privacy (WEP) specification to the newest Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) specification.
