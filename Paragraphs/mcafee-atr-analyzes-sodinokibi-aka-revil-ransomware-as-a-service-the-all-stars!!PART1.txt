By John Fokker and Christiaan Beek on Oct 02, 2019 Episode 2: The All-Stars Analyzing Affiliate Structures in Ransomware-as-a-Service Campaigns
This is the second installment of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) analysis of Sodinokibi and its connections to GandGrab, the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Campaign of 2018 and mid-2019.
GandCrab announced its retirement at the end of May.
Since then, a new RaaS family called Sodinokibi, aka REvil, took its place as one of the most prolific ransomware campaigns.
In episode one of our analysis on the Sodinokibi RaaS campaign we shared our extensive malware and post-infection analysis, which included code comparisons to GandCrab, and insight on exactly how massive the new Sodinokibi campaign is.
