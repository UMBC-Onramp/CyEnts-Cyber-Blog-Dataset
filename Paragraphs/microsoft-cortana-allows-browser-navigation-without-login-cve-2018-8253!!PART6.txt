That leaves us with the official website.
You might recognize this terminology: It is a common link presented by Wikipedia.
If you look at the bottom of a Wikipedia article, you will often find a link to an official website.
Could Cortana just use Wikipedia as a trusted source?
After a few delightful conversations with her, we can confirm that the official website for items she refers from Wikipedia is indeed the same as the Official Website link on Wikipedia.
There is no one-to-one correlation on Wikipedia’s official website for Cortana to display the corresponding link.
We assume there is some possible weighting of the domain name or logic in the Bing output that influences Cortana’s displayed links.
We can leverage this information to craft a fake Wikipedia entry, add enough content to get the review to succeed, add an official website link, and see what Cortana presents.
Wikipedia reviewers do a pretty good job of vetting content, but we also need Bing to become aware of the entry so that Cortana could offer the answer and the link.
Because of the time-dependent factor of the approach (and the ethical aspect of tampering with Wikipedia content in a malicious way), we decided to take a different path—although others could use this attack vector.
