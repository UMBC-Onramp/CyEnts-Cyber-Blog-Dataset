Is APKPure safe now?
On April 8, we informed APKPure about the issue.
On April 9, APKPure representatives replied that they saw the problem and were working on the fix.
Shortly after that, a new version (3.17.19) appeared on the APKPure website.
According to its description , the update “Fixed a potential security problem, making APKPure safer to use.”
We can confirm that the problem has indeed been fixed: APKPure 3.17.19 doesn’t contain the malicious component.
