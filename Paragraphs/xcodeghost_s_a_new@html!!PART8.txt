Figure 8: An App Store app is infected with XcodeGhost S Enterprise Protection FireEye MTP has detected and assisted in Appleâ€™s takedown of thousands of XcodeGhost-infected iOS applications.
We advise all organizations to notify their employees of the threat of XcodeGhost and other malicious iOS apps.
Employees should make sure that they update all apps to the latest version.
For the apps Apple has removed, users should remove the apps and switch to other uninfected apps on App Store.
FireEye
MTP management customers have full visibility into which mobile devices are infected in their deployment base.
We recommend that customers immediately review MTP alerts, locate infected devices/users, and quarantine the devices until the infected apps are removed.
FireEye NX customers are advised to immediately review alert logs for activities related to XcodeGhost communications.
