This month Apple tried to respond to the avalanche of criticism by issuing a long statement .
It acknowledged that before releasing AirTag it hadn’t envisioned all the ways of using it — whether legal or illegal.
It pledged to tell AirTag buyers more explicitly that AirTags are not to be used for tracking people.
It also plans to raise the volume of the beep that helps you find an AirTag someone has planted on your belongings.
