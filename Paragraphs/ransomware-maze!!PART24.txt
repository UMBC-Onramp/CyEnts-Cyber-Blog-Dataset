Generate a new random extension for the victim file.
Each file has a different extension but does not lose the original extension; the new one is appended to the old one.
For example, “1.zip” becomes “1.zip.gthf”.
Crypt the file with the ChaCha algorithm and the key and iv with the RSA public key generated in runtime.
Write this new block with the key and iv to decrypt at the end of the file.
Rename the file with the function “MoveFileExW”.
