Uses a custom XOR-based decryption routine to decrypt the Locky payload.
Ensures the decrypted binary is of a predefined size.
In Figure 4 below, the size of the decrypted binary had to be greater than 143,360 bytes and smaller than 153,660 bytes to be executed.

Payload download function in JavaScript 5.
     Checks (Figure 5) that the first two bytes of the binary contain the “MZ” header signature.

     Executes the decrypted payload by passing it the command line parameter, “123”.
