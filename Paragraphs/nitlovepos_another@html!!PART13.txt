The information contained in the NitlovePOS beacon matches the fields that are displayed in the Nitbot control panel.
These include the machines GIUD that is transmitted in the User-Agent header as well as an identifier “HWAWAWAWA,” which aligns with the “group name” that can be used by the cybercriminals to track various campaigns.
The control panel contains a view that lists the “tracks,” or stolen payment card data.
This indicates that this panel is for malware capable of stealing data from POS machines that matches up with the capability of the NitlovePOS malware.
Conclusion Even cybercriminals engaged in indiscriminate spam operations have POS malware available and can deploy it to s subset of their victims.
Due to the widespread use of POS malware, they are eventually discovered and detection increases.
However, this is followed by the development of new POS with very similar functionality.
Despite the similarity, the detection levels for new variants are initially quite low.
This gives the cybercriminals a window of opportunity to exploit the use of a new variant.
We expect that new versions of functionally similar POS malware will continue to emerge to meet the demand of the cybercrime marketplace.
