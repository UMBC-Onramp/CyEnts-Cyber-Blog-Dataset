We recently investigated a consumer product produced by Belkin.
Our research into the Wemo Insight Smart Plug led to the discovery of an unreported buffer overflow in the libUPnPHndlr.so library.
This flaw, CVE-2018-6692, allows an attacker to execute remote code.
Following our responsible disclosure policy, we reported this research to Belkin on May 21.
Can this vulnerability lead to a useful attack?
A smart plug by itself has a low impact.
An attacker could turn off the switch or at worst possibly overload the switch.
