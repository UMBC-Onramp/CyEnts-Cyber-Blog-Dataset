Delivery of shell scripts The shell script performs the following activities:
Attempts to kill already running cryptominers Figure 11: Terminating processes matching certain strings Downloads and executes cryptominer malware Figure 12: Downloading CryptoMiner Creates a cron job to maintain persistence Figure 13: Cron job for persistence Tries to kill other potential miners to hog the CPU usage Figure 14: Terminating other potential miners The function shown in Figure 14 is used to find processes that have high CPU usage and terminate them.
This terminates other potential miners and maximizes the utilization of resources.
Conclusion Use of cryptocurrency mining malware is a popular tactic leveraged by financially-motivated cyber criminals to make money from victims.
