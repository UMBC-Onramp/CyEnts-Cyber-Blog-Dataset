To send stolen data to the attacker, it defines some variables containing the sender’s email address, password, SMTP server address, and SMTP port, as shown in figure 5.3.
It defines the variables in the class’s constructor function.
Besides sending data via email, this Snake Keylogger variant also offers FTP and Telegram methods to submit collected sensitive data to the attacker.
For FTP, the attacker needs to set up an FTP server and then tell Snake Keylogger the address of the FTP server and credentials for Snake Keylogger to upload stolen sensitive data.
