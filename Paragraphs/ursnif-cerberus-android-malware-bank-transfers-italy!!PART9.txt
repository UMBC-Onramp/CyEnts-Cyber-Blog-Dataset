The option to sideload APKs is not enabled by default on Android devices, and the choice to deliver the malware from a non-official source may have limited the spread of the campaign to a larger number of devices.
When Cerberus is downloaded to a new device, it takes into account the original bank name the victim attempted to access when the infection process was initiated.
A JavaScript function includes those details and ensures the victim continues to see a consistent message.
Here too, the ‘Jambo’ word repeats throughout the function, calling into action the jQuery library that orchestrates the malware’s script-based activity.

The fraudulent transaction itself takes place on the victims’ infected desktops (Windows-based devices).
