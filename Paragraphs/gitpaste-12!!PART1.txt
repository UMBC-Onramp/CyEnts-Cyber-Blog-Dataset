Gitpaste-12 is a new worm recently discovered by Juniper Threat Labs, which uses GitHub and Pastebin for housing component code and has at least 12 different attack modules available.
There is evidence of test code for possible future modules, indicating ongoing development for this malware.
For now, however, targets are Linux based x86 servers, as well as Linux ARM and MIPS based IoT devices.
This malware has been dubbed Gitpaste-12 because of the usage of GitHub, Pastebin and 12 ways to compromise the system.
The first GitPaste-12 first attacks were detected by Juniper Threat Labs on October 15, 2020.
Weâ€™ve reported both the Pastebin URL and the git repo in question and the git repo was closed on October 30, 2020.
This should stop the proliferation of this botnet.
The GitHub repository used at the time of discovery was as follows: https://github[.]com/

The first phase of the attack is the initial system compromise (note the details of compromises used by this worm will be discussed later in this piece).
This worm has 12 known attack modules and more under development.
The worm will attempt to use known exploits to compromise systems and may also attempt to brute force passwords.
