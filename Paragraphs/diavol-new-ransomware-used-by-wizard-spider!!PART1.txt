FortiGuard Labs ThreatÂ Research Report Affected Platforms: Windows Impact: Data encryption, Data destruction Threat Severity:
Critical Diavol Introduction
At the beginning of June, FortiEDR prevented a ransomware attack that had targeted one of our customers.
After successfully stopping the attack, we were able to isolate two suspicious files that, at the time, were not found on VirusTotal: locker.exe and locker64.dll .
In the timeline of the attack, locker.exe was deployed a day before locker64.dll.
While we were able to identify locker64.dll to be a Conti (v3) ransomware, locker.exe appeared to be entirely different.
