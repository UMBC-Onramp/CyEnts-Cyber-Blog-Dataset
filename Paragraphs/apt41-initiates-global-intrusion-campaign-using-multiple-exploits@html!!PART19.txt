Discovery Rules
The following Yara rules serve as examples of discovery rules for APT41 actor TTPs, turning the adversary methods or tradecraft into new haystacks for purposes of detection or hunting.
For all tradecraft-based discovery rules, we recommend deliberate testing and tuning prior to implementation in any production system.
Some of these rules are tailored to build concise haystacks that are easy to review for high-fidelity detections.
Some of these rules are broad in aperture that build larger haystacks for further automation or processing in threat hunting systems.
