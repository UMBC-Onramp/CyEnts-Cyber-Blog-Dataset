As such, protections and considerations need to be present to be able to protect against this.
NAND is also much faster to erase and write, making it ideal for storing file systems, kernels, and other pieces of code that may need to be reset or changed.
NOR has significantly faster read times but is not as flexible with accessing data and has low erase and write speeds.
NOR is usually used for low-level bootloaders, hardcoded firmware blobs, and other areas that are not expected to change frequently.
The X2e uses a NAND flash.
Serial verses Parallel : This refers to how the data is accessed and is typically visually identifiable.
If there are a large number of pins, the flash is likely parallel.
Serial NOR chips can be small in size and typically need eight or fewer pins to function.
