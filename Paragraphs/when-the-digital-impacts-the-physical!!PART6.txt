But as the threat landscape is evolving, so is the industry determined to protect innocent users everywhere.
We at McAfee are working together with our entire industry to stop these types of attacks.
We’re sharing threat intelligence, resources, and research findings to ensure we put up a united front against these threats.
By learning from these attacks, we’re better preparing for those to come.
We believe that together is power.
And though these attacks are advanced, we know that acting together to stop them will be even more powerful.
