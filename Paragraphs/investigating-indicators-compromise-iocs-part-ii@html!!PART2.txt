Summary of significant artifacts John examines the timeline in order to surmise the following chain of activities: On October 15, 2013, at approximately 16:17:56 UTC, the attacker performed a type 3 network logon, described here , to \"ACMWH-KIOSK\" from \"ACM-BOBBO\" using the ACME domain service account, \"backupDaily.\" A few seconds later, the attacker copied two executables, \"acmCleanup.exe\" and \"msspcheck.exe,\" from \"ACM-BOBBO\" to \"C:$RECYCLE.BIN.\" By generating MD5 hashes of both files, John determines that \"acmCleanup.exe\" is identical to the similarly named file on \"ACM-BOBBO\", which means it won't require malware analysis.
Since the MD5 hash of \"msspcheck.exe\" was not previously identified, John sends binary to a malware analyst, whose analysis reveals that \"msspcheck.exe\" is a variant of the \"acmCleanup.exe\" malware.
About a minute later, at 16:19:02 UTC, the attacker executed the Sysinternals PsExec remote command execution utility, which ran for approximately three minutes.
During this time period, event logs recorded the start and stop of the \"WCE SERVICE\" service, which corresponds to the execution of the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE).
