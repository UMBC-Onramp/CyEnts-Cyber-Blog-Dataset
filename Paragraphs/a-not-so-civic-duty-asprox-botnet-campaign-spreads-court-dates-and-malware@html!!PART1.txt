Executive Summary FireEye Labs has been tracking a recent spike in malicious email detections that we attribute to a campaign that began in 2013.
While malicious email campaigns are nothing new, this one is significant in that we are observing mass-targeting attackers adopting the malware evasion methods pioneered by the stealthier APT attackers.
And this is certainly a high-volume business, with anywhere from a few hundred to ten thousand malicious emails sent daily â€“ usually distributing between 50 and 500,000 emails per outbreak.
Through the FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) cloud , FireEye Labs discovered that each and every major spike in email blasts brought a change in the attributes of their attack.
