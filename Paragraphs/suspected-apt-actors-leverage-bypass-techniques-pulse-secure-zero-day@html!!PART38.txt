This patcher utility is a simple bash script, unlike the previous patchers which were compiled applications likely written in C. The script in full is: printf '\\xB8' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B31)) printf '\\x01' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B32))
printf '\\x00' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B33)) printf '\\x00' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B34)) printf '\\x00' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B35))
