Conclusion It is common for malware to use techniques that mask the Windows API being used.
These techniques force malware analysts to have to extract data from runtime data, calculate entry point addresses, and then resolve their meaning within the context of a particular running process.
In previous techniques, several manual stages were involved that were bulky and time intensive.
This blog introduces a small simple open source tool that can integrate well into multiple IDA scripting languages.
This combination allows analysts streamlined access to the data required to quickly bypass these types of obfuscations and continue on with their analysis.
We are happy to be able to open source the remote lookup application so that others may benefit and adapt it to their own needs.
Sample network clients have been provided for Python, C#, D, and VB6.
