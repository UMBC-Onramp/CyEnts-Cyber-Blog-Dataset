Hunting Strategies
If an organization identifies a host with an active infection believed to be an instance of KEGTAP or a parallel malware family, the following containment actions are recommended.
Note that due to the velocity of this intrusion activity, these actions should be taken in parallel.
Isolate and perform a forensic review of any impacted systems.
Review incoming emails to the user that owns the impacted device for emails matching the distribution campaigns, and take action to remove the messages from all mailboxes.
Identify the URLs used by the phishing campaign and block them using proxy or network security devices.
Reset credentials for any user accounts associated with execution of the malware.
Perform an enterprise wide review for lateral movement authentication from the impacted systems.
Check authentication logs from any single-factor remote access solutions that may exist (VPN, VDI, etc) and move towards multi-factor authentication (MFA) as soon as possible.
An enterprise-wide effort should be made to identify host-based artifacts related to the execution of first-stage malware and all post-intrusion activity associated with this activity.
