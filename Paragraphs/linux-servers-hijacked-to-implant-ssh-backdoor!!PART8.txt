(As weâ€™ll discuss below, the malware uses an encryption algorithm with an 8-byte block size, but even unencrypted messages are always a multiple of 8 in length .)
Following is the first packet sent to the server after the TCP handshake, with the 8-byte message highlighted.
Figure 7.
Initial TCP packet to C2 server, with payload highlighted.
The C2 server replies with the following message (TCP packet omitted for clarity) : Figure 8.
Server response.
The response consists of a header with the payload length (24 bytes), a command (0x0201), and the CRC32 checksum of the payload.
