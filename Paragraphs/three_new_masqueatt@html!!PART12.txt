If installed before the target app, the malicious\nextension can break the data container and gain full access to the\ntarget app's data container without usersâ€™ awareness, while the\ntarget app would work normally.
If the malicious extension\nis installed after the target app, the target app can no\nlonger access its own data container.
Thus the functionality of the\ntarget app will be seriously disturbed and the app will even crash\n(causing denial-of-service).
In this circumstance, if the victim\ntries to reinstall the target app, the target app would recover.
