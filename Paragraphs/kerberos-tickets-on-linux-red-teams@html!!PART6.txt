The server validates the service ticket and authenticates the user.
If the server determines that the user has permissions to access the share, the user can begin making SMB queries.
For an in-depth example of how Kerberos authentication works, scroll down to view the appendix at the bottom of this article.
Kerberos On Linux Domain-Joined Systems When a Linux system is joined to an Active Directory domain, it also needs to use Kerberos tickets to access services on the Windows Active Directory domain.
Linux uses a different Kerberos implementation.
Instead of Windows formatted tickets (commonly referred to as the KIRBI format), Linux uses MIT format Kerberos Credential Caches (CCACHE files).
When a user on a Linux system wants to access a remote service with Kerberos, such as a file share, the same procedure is used to request the TGT and corresponding service ticket.
In older, more traditional implementations, Linux systems often stored credential cache files in the /tmp directory.
Although the files are locked down and not world-readable, a malicious user with root access to the Linux system could trivially obtain a copy of the Kerberos tickets and reuse them.
On modern versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) is used to manage Kerberos tickets on domain-joined systems.
SSSD implements its own form of Kerberos Cache Manager (KCM) and encrypts tickets within a database on the system.
