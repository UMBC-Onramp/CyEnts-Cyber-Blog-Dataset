Think.
Consider the incoming message soberly.
In the fake Mina example, ask yourself why such a generous (weird but generous) offer would have no buzz in specialized communities?
Could the sender be trying to exploit your FOMO?
Why the need to use no link but the one in the letter?
Why does the letter ask you to spread the information among your contacts?
There’s no proof of scam here, but plenty of food for thought.
Check.
Visit the issuer’s official website by typing its address into your browser’s address bar.
Read any coverage of the ICO project on specialized resources.
Check the real cryptoproject servers in Discord, which stay on top of scams and post warnings.
However you choose to research and verify, never drop your guard: Scammers have built entire fake news sites to lend credibility to cyberscams.
Protect.
The human factor is not infallible; we need automatic defenses for added security.
A reliable protection solution, such as Kaspersky Internet Security , will warn you if someone tries to redirect you to a malicious, phishing, or scam website.
