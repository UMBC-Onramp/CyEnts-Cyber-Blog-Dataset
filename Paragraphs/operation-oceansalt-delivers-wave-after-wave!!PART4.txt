The code to our knowledge, however, has never been made public.
Alternatively, this could be a “false flag” operation to suggest that we are seeing the re-emergence of Comment Crew.
Creating false flags is a common practice.
What Really Matters It is likely that reactions to this research will focus on debating the identity of the threat actor.
Although this question is of great interest, answering it will require more than the technical evidence that private industry can provide.
These limitations are frustrating.
However, we can focus on the indicators of compromise presented in this report to detect, correct, and protect our systems, regardless of the source of these attacks.
Perhaps more important is the possible return of a previously dormant threat actor and, further, why should this campaign occur now?
Regardless of whether this is a false flag operation to suggest the rebirth of Comment Crew, the impact of the attack is unknown.
However, one thing is certain.
Threat actors have a wealth of code available to leverage new campaigns, as previous research from the Advanced Threat Research team has revealed.
