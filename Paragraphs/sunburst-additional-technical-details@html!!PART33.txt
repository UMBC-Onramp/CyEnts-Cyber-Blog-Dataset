This is a huge amount of compute power that members of the community provided free-of-charge to help others.
We want to thank everyone who contributed hashes and specifically callout the Hashcat community, which organized to systematically break each hash.
This was essential for breaking the final few hashes whose preimage were of considerable length.
Acknowledgements Matthew Williams, Michael Sikorski, Alex Berry and Robert Wallace.
