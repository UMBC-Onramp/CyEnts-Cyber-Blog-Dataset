In this example, it was only set to emulate from 0x401514 to 0x40153D .
  
This interface provides an easy way for the user to specify values for given registers and stack arguments.
If a bytestring is specified, it is written to the emulator’s memory and the pointer is written to the register or stack variable.
After emulation, the user can make use of flare-emu ’s utility functions to read data from the emulated memory or registers, or use the Unicorn emulation object that is returned for direct probing in case flare-emu does not expose some functionality you require.
A small wrapper function for emulateRange , named emulateSelection , can be used to emulate the range of instructions currently highlighted in IDA Pro.
