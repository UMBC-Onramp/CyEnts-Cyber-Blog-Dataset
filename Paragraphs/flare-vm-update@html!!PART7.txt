You can also safely uninstall all FLARE VM packages by executing “choco uninstall flarevm.installer.flare”.
Our new FLARE VM is also updated to use Python 3.7 as the default Python interpreter.
As a result, many python scripts may fail to execute.
To maintain support for older scripts, we keep Python 2.7 installed in parallel with Python 3.7.
We can easily switch between different versions by using the Python launcher.
Run “py -2.7 <path_to_python_script>” to use Python 2.7, or “py <path_to_python_script>” to use the default Python 3.7 interpreter.
For more details on the Python launcher, please refer to the following URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher.
Additionally, the new FLARE VM changes the location where Fakenet-NG saves its output when launched via the shortcut in the FLARE folder or taskbar pin.
