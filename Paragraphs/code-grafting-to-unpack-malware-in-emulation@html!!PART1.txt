This blog post continues the FLARE script series with a discussion of patching IDA Pro database files (IDBs) to interactively emulate code.
While the fastest way to analyze or unpack malware is often to run it, malware won’t always successfully execute in a VM.
I use IDA Pro’s Bochs integration in IDB mode to sidestep tedious debugging scenarios and get quick results.
Bochs emulates the opcodes directly from your IDB in a Bochs VM with no OS.
Bochs IDB mode eliminates distractions like switching VMs, debugger setup, neutralizing anti-analysis measures, and navigating the program counter to the logic of interest.
