One prediction is made per entity, even if a tweet contains multiple entities.
Filtering tweets that do not contain named entities reduces tweets to only those relevant to expressing observations on a software vulnerability.
From these normalized tweets, we can gain insight into how strongly users are emphasizing the importance of the vulnerability by observing their choice of words.
The choice of adjective is instrumental in the classifier capturing the strong opinions.
Twitter users often use strong adjectives and superlatives to convey magnitude in a tweet or when stressing the importance of something related to a vulnerability like in Figure 4.
This magnitude often indicates to the model when a vulnerabilityâ€™s exploitation is widespread.
Table 1 shows our analysis of important adjectives that tend to indicate a more severe vulnerability.
