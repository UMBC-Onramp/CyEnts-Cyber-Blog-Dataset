These metrics, in combination with the observed swiftness of adversary exploitation activity, highlight the importance of responsible disclosure, as it may provide defenders with the slim window needed to successfully patch vulnerable systems.
Exploitation After Patch Release While the majority of the observed vulnerabilities were zero-days, 42 percent of vulnerabilities were exploited after a patch had been released.
For these non-zero-day vulnerabilities, there was a very small window (often only hours or a few days) between when the patch was released and the first observed instance of attacker exploitation.
Table 1 provides some insight into the race between attackers attempting to exploit vulnerable software and organizations attempting to deploy the patch.
Time to Exploit for Vulnerabilities First Exploited after a Patch Hours Two vulnerabilities were successfully exploited within hours of a patch release, CVE-2018-2628 and CVE-2018-7602.
