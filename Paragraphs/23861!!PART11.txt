Mobile/15E148 Version/15.0 Always use a VPN that masks your traffic.
Some exploits are delivered through GSM operator MitM attacks, when browsing HTTP sites or by DNS hijack.
Using a VPN to mask the traffic makes it difficult for your GSM operator to target you directly over the Internet.
It also complicates the targeting process if the attackers have control over your data stream, such as while in roaming.
Please note that not all VPNs are the same and not any VPN is fine to use.
Without favoring any specific VPN provider, here’s a few things to consider when you shop for a VPN subscription with anonymity being a top priority:
Purchase means just that — no “free” VPNs.
Look for services that you can accept payment with cryptocurrencies.
Look for services that do not require you to provide any registration info.
Try to avoid VPN apps — instead, use open-source tools such as OpenVPN, WireGuard and VPN profiles.
