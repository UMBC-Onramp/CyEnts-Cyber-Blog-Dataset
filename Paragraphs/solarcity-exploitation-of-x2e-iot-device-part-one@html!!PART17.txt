This is typically implemented as either a kernel driver or an external NAND controller.
Managed NAND means that the IC package includes the controller and transparently manages the data.
This is extremely common in embedded devices, as either embedded MMC (eMMC) or universal flash storage (UFS).
The X2e uses unmanaged flash and is controlled by the main microcontroller present on the PCB.
With the basics out of the way, we proceeded with physically removing the chip from the PCB.
