In an official Android app store, be it Google Play or Huawei AppGallery, employees of the respective owner companies screen every application submitted by developers, weeding out any that are clearly malicious.
These are large companies that protect their reputations and customersâ€™ security, and they have both the resources and the motivation to help keep users malware-free.
Sometimes, however, malware does get through , and even into Google Play, although the chances of encountering it there are much lower than on message boards, torrent trackers, or some other sites.
Proudly small, independent marketplaces tend not to run many checks, typically because they lack the resources, and as a result, the apps they host could be anything in disguise, even a Trojan.
We should mention here that downloading malware to an Android device is not usually enough to infect it.
Unless the malware relies on some kind of zero-day uber-exploit to get superuser permissions , installing a dangerous app in Android requires some effort.
