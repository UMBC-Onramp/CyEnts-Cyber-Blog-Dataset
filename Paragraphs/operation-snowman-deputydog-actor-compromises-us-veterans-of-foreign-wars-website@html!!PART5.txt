Shellcode analysis
Subsequently, the malicious Flash code downloads a file containing the dropped malware payload.
The beginning of the file is a JPG image; the end of the file (offset 36321) is the payload, encoded with an XOR key of 0x95.
The attacker appends the payload to the shellcode before pivoting to code control.
Then, when the shellcode is executed, the malware creates files “sqlrenew.txt” and “stream.exe”.
The tail of the image file is decoded, and written to these files.
“sqlrenew.txt” is then executed with the LoadLibraryA Windows API call.
ZxShell payload analysis As documented above, this exploit dropped an XOR (0x95) payload that executed a ZxShell backdoor (MD5: 8455bbb9a210ce603a1b646b0d951bce).
