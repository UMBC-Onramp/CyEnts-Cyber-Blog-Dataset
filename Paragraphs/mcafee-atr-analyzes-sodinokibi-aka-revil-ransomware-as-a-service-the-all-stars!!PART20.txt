In the end there were still some samples from which we had to pull the configs manually.
The JSON file contains different values and fields; for a comparison to GandCrab we focused on the PID and SUB field of each sample as these values appeared to have a similar characteristic as the ID and SUB_ID field in the GandCrab samples.

REVIL JSON CONFIG VALUES Interpreting the Data Structures With the data we gathered, we used the same analysis methodology on Sodinokibi Â as we did on GandCrab.
We discovered that Sodinokibi has a RaaS structure very similar to GandCrab and with the Parent-Child relationship structure being nearly identical.
Below we compared activity of GandCrab affiliate number 99 with the activity of the Sodinokibi affiliate number 19.

It needs to be said that the timespan for the GandCrab overview was generated over a long period of time with a larger total of samples than the Sodinokibi overview.
Nevertheless, the similarity is quit striking.
The activity of both ID numbers displays a tree-shaped structure with the parent ID number at the root and branching out to the respective SUB numbers linked to multiple samples.
