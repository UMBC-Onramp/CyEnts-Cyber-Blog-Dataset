We suspect it is a constant, but this value is still unknown to us.
Figure 6: Excerpt TS_cnames.pyc TS_names array, which contain TRITON actor’s notes for execution command function codes TriStation Protocol Packet Structure The TRITON threat actor’s knowledge and reverse engineering effort provides us a better understanding of the protocol.
From here we can start to form a more complete picture and document the basic functionality of TriStation.
We are primarily interested in message type 5, Execution Command, which best illustrates the overall structure of the protocol.
Other, smaller message types will have varying structure.
Figure 7: Sample TriStation \"Allocate Program\" Execution Command, with color annotation and protocol legend Corroborating the TriStation Analysis Minute discrepancies aside, the TriStation structure detailed in Figure 7 is supported by other public analyses.
Foremost, researchers from the Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign published a 2017 paper titled \" Attack Induced Common-Mode Failures on PLC-based Safety System in a Nuclear Power Plant\".
The CSL team mentions that they used the Triconex System Access Application (TSAA) protocol to reverse engineer elements of the TriStation protocol.
