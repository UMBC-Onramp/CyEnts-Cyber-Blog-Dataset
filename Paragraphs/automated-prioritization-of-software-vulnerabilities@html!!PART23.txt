In our work, we found that social media content that pre-dates CVE scoring releases can be effectively used by machine learning models to forecast vulnerability scores and prioritize vulnerabilities days before they are made available.
Our approach incorporates a novel social sentiment component, which CVE scores do not, and it allows scores to better predict real-world exploitation of vulnerabilities.
Finally, our approach allows for a more practical prioritization of software vulnerabilities effectively indicating the few that are likely to be weaponized by attackers.
NIST has acknowledged that the current CVSS methodology is insufficient.
The current process of scoring CVSS is expected to be replaced by ML-based solutions by October 2019, with limited human involvement.
However, there is no indication of utilizing a social component in the scoring effort.
This work was led by researchers at Ohio State under the IARPA CAUSE program, with support from Leidos and FireEye.
