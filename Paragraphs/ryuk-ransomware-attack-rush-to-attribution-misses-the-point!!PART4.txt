We used the term pseudo-ransomware to describe this attack.
The malware was Hermes version 2.1.
One of the functions we often see in ransomware samples is that they will not execute if the victimâ€™s system language is one of the following: 419 (Russian) 422 (Ukrainian) 423 (Belarusian)
That was October 2017.
Searching earlier events, we noticed a posting from August 2017 in an underground forum in which a Russian-speaking actor offered the malware kit Hermes 2.1 ransomware: What if the actor who attacked the Taiwanese bank simply bought a copy of Hermes and added it to the campaign to cause the distraction?
Why go to the trouble to build something, when the actor can just buy the perfect distraction in an underground forum?
