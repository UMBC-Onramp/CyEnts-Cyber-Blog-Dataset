Figure 16 An error message gave us a clue on why the crash occurred, indicating a watchdog timer failure.
Watchdog timers are common in critical embedded devices that if the system hangs for a predetermined amount of time, it takes action to try and correct the problem.
In this case, the action chosen by the developers is to reboot the system.
Searching the system binaries for this error message revealed the section of code shown in Figure 17.
Â  
The actual error messages have been redacted at the request of the vendor.
Figure 17 The function is decrementing three counters.
If any of the counters ever get to zero, then an error is thrown and later the system is rebooted.
Examining the code further shows that multiple processes call this function to check the counters very frequently.
This means we are not going to be able to dynamically debug the system without figuring out how to disable this software watchdog.
