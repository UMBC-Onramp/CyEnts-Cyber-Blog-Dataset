The recent DarkSide attack makes it clear: no system is safe from ransomware.
And while the attackers say they weren’t out to hurt anyone, only to make money, the impact is the same.
It could lead to potential disruptions of critical services across the country.
At the same time, it stokes fears that similar attacks could happen more often in the future.
The long-term outcome of these attacks, however, is a hyper-focus on ransomware as the top threat to governments and enterprises.
For example, the federal government recently pledged billions of dollars to fight ransomware.
There’s no doubt that ransomware remains a major (and evolving) risk.
