Three of these vulnerabilities exist in the form of flaws in the Wi-Fi standard itself.
The rest result from programming errors made by Wi-Fi makers.
These enable attackers to compromise devices on the network and steal data.
What Can FragAttacks Do?
When attackers exploit FragAttacks, they could run malicious code, take control of devices, capture data and use the devices to launch other attacks.
The good news is these attacks aren’t easy, or even possible at scale.
In order to exploit FragAttacks, the attackers must be in radio range of the network.
They also require users to take action or unusual network settings.
As such, FragAttacks aren’t practical as large-scale attacks.
Researchers have never found FragAttacks being exploited in the wild.
However, cyber attackers now know they exist.
And the clock is ticking.
A Closer Look Attackers can exploit FragAttacks to steal data via a Wi-Fi network, bypassing Wi-Fi encryption that should be protecting the data.
