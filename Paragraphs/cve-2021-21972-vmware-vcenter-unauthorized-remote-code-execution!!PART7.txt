It is using the ‘ vsphere-ui ’ user access permissions while uploading the file .
Since it accepts the file upload, we can generate public key on the a ttacker machine and upload it to vCenter Server ’s ‘ vsphere-ui ’ user SSH direct or y and try to connect to the server via SSH using the private key , then we can achieve the shell of the vCenter server.
This is how it goes: Let’s verify the SSH service is running or not, checking port 22
It is running SSH service.
So, we can proceed further and generate public key on a ttacker machine.
W e will generate the k ey pair : generating the key pair U pload the public key and exploit ed the vulnerability.
