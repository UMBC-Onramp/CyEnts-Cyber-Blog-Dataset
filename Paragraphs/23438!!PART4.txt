Google will most likely reveal more details on the vulnerabilities after the majority of users have up-dated their browsers.
In any case, it’s not worth delaying the update — much better do it as soon as possible.
How to stay safe The first step for everyone is to update browsers on all devices that have access to the Internet.
Quite often the update is installed automatically when the browser is restarted, however many users do not restart their computer for a long time, so their browser may remain vulnerable for several days or even weeks.
In any case, we recommend checking the version of Chrome.
Here’s how to do it: click on the Customise and Control Google Chrome button at the top-right corner of the browser window and choose Help -> About Google Chrome .
