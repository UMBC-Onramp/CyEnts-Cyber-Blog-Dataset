Users have long needed to access important resources such as virtual private networks (VPNs), web applications, and mail servers from anywhere in the world at any time.
While the ability to access resources from anywhere is imperative for employees, threat actors often leverage stolen credentials to access systems and data.
Due to large volumes of remote access connections, it can be difficult to distinguish between a legitimate and a malicious login.
Today, we are releasing GeoLogonalyzer to help organizations analyze logs to identify malicious logins based on GeoFeasibility; for example, a user connecting to a VPN from New York at 13:00 is unlikely to legitimately connect to the VPN from Australia five minutes later.
