Examples Figure 4 shows a few blocks of code that call a function that takes a timestamp value and converts it to a string.
Figure 5 shows a simple script that uses flare-emu â€™s iterate API to print the arguments passed to this function for each place it is called.
The script also emulates a simple XOR decode function and prints the resulting, decoded string.
Figure 6 shows the resulting output of the script.
