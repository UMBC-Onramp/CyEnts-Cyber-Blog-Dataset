We discovered a new class of security issues, which we call JavaScript Sidedoor ( JS sidedoor ), in ad libraries.
If an ad library uses the @JavascriptInterface annotation to expose security-sensitive interfaces, and uses HTTP to load content in the WebView, then it is vulnerable to attacks where an attacker over the network (e.g., via WIFI or DNS hijacking) could inject malicious content into the WebView to misuse the interfaces exposed through the JS binding annotation.
We call these exposed JS binding annotation interfaces JS sidedoors .
For example, starting with version 3.6.2, InMobi added the @JavascriptInterface JS binding annotation.
