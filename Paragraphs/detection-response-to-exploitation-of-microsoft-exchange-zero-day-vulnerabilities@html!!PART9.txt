The file, depicted in Figure 3, matches signatures for the tried-and-true China Chopper .
Figure 3: Snippet of China Chopper web shell found on a compromised Exchange Server system We observed that in at least two cases, the threat actors subsequently issued the following command against the Exchange web server: net group \"Exchange Organization administrators\" administrator /del /domain.
This command attempts to delete the administrator user from the Exchange Organizations administrators group, beginning with the Domain Controller in the current domain.
If the system is in a single-system domain, it will execute on the local computer.
Per Microsoftâ€™s blog, they have identified additional post-exploitation activities, including: Credential theft via dumping of LSASS process memory.
Compression of data for exfiltration via 7-Zip.
Use of Exchange PowerShell Snap-ins to export mailbox data.
Use of additional offensive security tools Covenant , Nishang , and PowerCat for remote access.
The activity we have observed, coupled with others in the information security industry, indicate that these threat actors are likely using Exchange Server vulnerabilities to gain a foothold into environments.
This activity is followed quickly by additional access and persistent mechanisms.
As previously stated, we have multiple ongoing cases and will continue to provide insight as we respond to intrusions.
