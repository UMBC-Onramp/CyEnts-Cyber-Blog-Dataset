Attacker Hostnames Match Victim Environment The actor sets the hostnames on their command and control infrastructure to match a legitimate hostname found within the victim’s environment.
This allows the adversary to blend into the environment, avoid suspicion, and evade detection.
Detection Opportunity
The attacker infrastructure leaks its configured hostname in RDP SSL certificates, which is identifiable in internet-wide scan data.
This presents a detection opportunity for defenders -- querying internet-wide scan data sources for an organization’s hostnames can uncover malicious IP addresses that may be masquerading as the organization.
