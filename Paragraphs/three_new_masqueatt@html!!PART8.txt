The dummy placeholder will disappear after the victim restarts the device.
Also, as shown in Table 1, a manifest file can contain different apps’ metadata entries to distribute multiple apps at a time, which means this vulnerability can cause multiple apps being demolished with just one click by the victim.
By leveraging this vulnerability, one app developer can install his/her own app and demolish other apps (e.g. a competitor’s app) at the same time.
In this way, attackers can perform DoS attacks or phishing attacks on iOS.
Figure 1.
Phishing Attack by installing “malicious Chrome” and demolishing the genuine one Figure 1 shows an example of the phishing attack.
When the user clicks a URL in the Gmail app, this URL is rewritten with the “googlechrome-x-callback://” scheme and supposed to be handled by Chrome on the device.
However, an attacker can leverage the Manifest Masque vulnerability to demolish the genuine Chrome and install “malicious Chrome” registering the same scheme.
