These word embedding representations are machine friendly, and similar words are often assigned similar representations.
Word embeddings are domain specific.
In our work, we additionally train terminology specific to cyber security topics, such as related words to threats are defenses , cyberrisk , cybersecurity , threat , and iot-based .
The embedding would allow a classifier to implicitly combine the knowledge of similar words and the meaning of how concepts differ.
