IDA Pro and the Hex Rays decompiler are a core part of any toolkit for reverse engineering and vulnerability research.
In a previous blog post we discussed how the Hex-Rays API can be used to solve small, well-defined problems commonly seen as part of malware analysis.
Having access to a higher-level representation of binary code makes the Hex-Rays decompiler a powerful tool for reverse engineering.
However, interacting with the HexRays API and its underlying data sources can be daunting, making the creation of generic analysis scripts difficult or tedious.
This blog post introduces the FLARE IDA Decompiler Library (FIDL) , FireEyeâ€™s open source library which provides a wrapper layer around the Hex-Rays API.
Background Output from the Hex-Rays decompiler is exposed to analysts via an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
