Update as of July 7 th : This sophisticated supply-chain ransomware attack initially leveraged a vulnerability in the Kaseya VSA software to gain access to victim organizations, and then used REvilâ€™s RaaS to infect those organizations with ransomware.
For that reason, FortiGuard Labs is providing a separate Outbreak Alert analysis for both the initial exploitation of the Kaseya vulnerability and for the subsequent REvil ransomware attack.
