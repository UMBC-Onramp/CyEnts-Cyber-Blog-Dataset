Since Stuxnet, researchers have discovered several industrial attacks; each year we seem to read about a worse threat than before.
In August 2017, a sophisticated malware targeted petrochemical facilities in the Middle East.
The malware—dubbed Triton, Trisis, or HatMan—attacked safety instrumented systems (SIS), a critical component that has been designed to protect human life.
The system targeted in that case was the Schneider Triconex SIS.
The initial vector of infection is still unknown, but it was likely a phishing attack.
After gaining remote access, the Triton attackers moved to disrupt, take down, or destroy the industrial process.
The goal of the attackers is still unclear because the attack was discovered after an accidental shutdown of the plant led to further investigation.
Investigations conducted by several security companies have revealed a complex malware framework embedding PowerPC shellcode (the Triconex architecture) and an implementation of the proprietary communication protocol TriStation.
The malware allowed the attackers to easily communicate with safety controllers and remotely manipulate system memory to inject shellcodes; they completely controlled the target.
