When choosing the manual option in the decryptor, the user has to supply a path of the specific file or choose “0” to finish.
However, choosing a “0” will put the decryptor into an infinite loop.
Looking at the decryptor, it is very worrisome to see that the criminals behind Ryuk can get away with such bad programming.
It shows a clear lack of empathy towards their victims and the absence of solid coding skills.
Victims who do pay the exorbitant ransom demand are far from in the clear.
The decryptor offered by the criminals has a very high risk of malfunctioning, resulting in permanent damage to their precious files.
