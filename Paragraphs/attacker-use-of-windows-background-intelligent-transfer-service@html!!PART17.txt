Unfortunately, while this was successful in identifying a previously unknown persistence mechanism associated with this threat group, manual QMGR database analysis would not scale across multiple systems or environments.
Adapting the existing BitsParser to parse the Windows 10 version of the QMGR database enabled Mandiant consultants to efficiently identify additional infected systems across multiple environments.

Conclusion The Background Intelligent Transfer Service continues to provide utility to applications and attackers alike.
The BITS QMGR database can present a useful source of data in an investigation or hunting operation.
BitsParser may be utilized with other forensic tools to develop a detailed view of attacker activity.
