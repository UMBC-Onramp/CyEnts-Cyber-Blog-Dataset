Without physical access to the device, an attacker wouldnâ€™t have a clear idea of how the backup image differs from the original or even if it is exploitable.
If the backup image uses a different version of the firmware, the exploit may no longer work.
Perhaps more importantly, a denial-of-service attack suffers from its inherent lack of subtlety.
If the attack immediately causes alarms to go off when executed, the attacker can expect that their persistence in the system will be short-lived.
