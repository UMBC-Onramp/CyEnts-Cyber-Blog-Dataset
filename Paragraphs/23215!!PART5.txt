How to defend against such attacks Practicing caution and using your device safely is key to keeping malware and other mobile nasties off your phone.
Generally speaking, follow these tips to avoid trouble:
Avoid installing apps from unofficial sources and use your device’s settings to deny permission to install them.
(If you need to install an app not from an official store, temporarily enable that permission and then disable it again); Use only official messaging apps, and download them only from official app stores — they may lack some features, but will not flood your phone with viruses; Check what permissions you’ve granted to installed apps — some might pose a real threat ; Install a reliable mobile antivirus app on your phone, and heed its warnings.
