Mandiant customers have access to more intelligence through our software and services.
As a security software company, FireEye deploys powerful appliances into customer environments to inspect and (if so desired) quarantine malicious content.
Most customers choose to benefit from the cloud features of the FireEye product suite .
This decision enables community self-defense and exposes a rich collection of the world's worst malware.
As millions more instances of FireEye's MVX technology expand to mobile, cloud and data center environments, all of us benefit in terms of protection and visibility.
Furthermore, FireEye's own threat intelligence and services components generate knowledge based on their visibility into adversary software and activity.
Recent examples include breaking news on Android malware, identifying Yahoo!
systems serving malware, and exploring \"cyber arms\" dealers.
Like Mandiant, FireEye's customers benefit from intelligence embedded into the MVX platforms.
Many have looked at the Mandiant and FireEye combination from the perspective of software and services.
While these are important, both ultimately depend on access to the best threat intelligence available.
