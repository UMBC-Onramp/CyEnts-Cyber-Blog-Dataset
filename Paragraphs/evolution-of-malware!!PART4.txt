NCP was the first network transport layer to enable data to flow from computer to computer.
In 1971, the first microprocessor was developed, the Intel 4004.
It was the first commercially produced general-purpose CPU.
Its size (two inches rather than 12), price ($60), and performance (comparable to much larger and more expensive processors) ushered in a new era in computing Ironically, 1971 also saw the premier of the world’s first virus Proof of Concept, dubbed “The Creeper.”
Although credited and referenced by various entities as the world’s first computer virus, the Creeper actually exhibited the behavior of a worm.
Based on a concept first articulated by German mathematician John von Neumann in the 1940s, it was built at BBN (an American research and development company later acquired by Raytheon) by engineer Bob Thomas.
It spread through ARPANET computers and posted the following message: \"I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!\" Like its modern worm successors, it spread via a network protocol.
The intent was not for malicious or devious reasons, but to see if the “I’m the creeper, catch me if you can” message could propagate to other computers via ARPANET.
