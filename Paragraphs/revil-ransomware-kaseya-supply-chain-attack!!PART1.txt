On July 2, 2021, Kaseya customers were notified of a compromise affecting the company’s VSA product in a way that poisoned the product’s update mechanism with malicious code.
VSA is a remote monitoring and management tool for networks and endpoints intended for use by enterprise customers and managed service providers (MSPs).
According to Kaseya, it urged customers to shut down the VSA to prevent attackers from gaining remote access to further assets.
Kaseya also shut down the cloud version of VSA and all SaaS servers as a precautionary measure.
Although it was initially believed that only 50 companies using VSA on-premises were targeted, the evolving situation reveals more potential victims as numbers climb to the tune of 1,500-2,000 companies likely exposed to downstream impact by this major attack.
The number of potential victims can be so much larger because Kaseya’s customers themselves are MSPs who serve a customer base of their own.
Consequently, those who rely on VSA to deliver remote-monitoring services can also be impacted by the attack.
