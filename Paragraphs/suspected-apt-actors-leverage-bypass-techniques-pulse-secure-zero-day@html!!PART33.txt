If the password matches, then the EAX register is overwritten to 1.
This puts the program in the same state as if DsSecID_checkLogin had successfully executed, but unlike SLOWPULSE VARIANT 1 the original authentication routine is not called at all.
The malicious logic then rejoins execution before DSAuth::AceAuthServer::handleACEAuthResult which will now pass.
This forces the application down the execution path of successful authentication, even though in reality authentication would have failed.
SLOWPULSE Variant 4
RealmSignin Two Factor Auth Bypass We identified a fourth variant of SLOWPULSE responsible for bypassing what may be the two-factor authentication step of the DSAuth::RealmSignin process.
The backdoor is present within the function
DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSigninStep .This routine is responsible for multiple steps of the login procedure and is implemented as a large switch statement.
