Each of the low sophistication incidents we observe is unique and poses a different level of risk, which we normally determine by examining the actor’s previous work and reputation, the target’s industry, and the nature of the compromised process, among other things.
While low sophistication incidents do not appear to commonly impact physical environments, they remain concerning for the following reasons.
Each incident provides threat actors with opportunities to learn more about OT, such as the underlying technology, physical processes, and operations.
These opportunities can increase an adversary's ability and enhance their tradecraft.
Even low-sophistication intrusions into OT environments carry the risk of disruption to physical processes, mainly in the case of industries or organizations with less mature security practices.
As the number of intrusions increase, so does the risk of process disruption.
The publicity of these incidents normalizes cyber operations against OT and may encourage other threat actors to increasingly target or impact these systems.
