To get this information it needs to call APIs RtlGetVersion() and GetNativeSystemInfo().
0x01 at offset+50h is a current process ID (rundll32.exe) related value.
The last data, starting at offset+58h, is meaningless padding (AB AB AB…).
The encrypted binary data will be converted into base64 string by calling the API CryptBinaryToStringW().
The base64 string is submitted to the C2 server as a “Cookies” value in an HTTP Get request.
In the example shown in Figure 5.2, as you may have noticed, the Cookie name and URL are randomized by Emotet to bypass the cybersecurity device’s detection.
