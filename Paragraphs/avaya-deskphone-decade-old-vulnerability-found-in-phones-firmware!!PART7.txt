Running this tool is always a good first step when facing an unknown firmware file as, in most cases, it will identify useful items for you.
When processing the phone’s firmware, extracting the files and running binwalk on them gave us the program the phone runs at startup (the bootloader), the Linux kernel used by the phone, and a JFFS filesystem that contains all the phone’s binaries and configuration files.
This is a great start, as from there we can start understanding the inner workings of the device and look for bugs.
