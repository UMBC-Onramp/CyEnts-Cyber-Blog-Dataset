Next, we noted that ten lines in Figure 10 hold base64-encoded data.
Once the sample was successfully deobfuscated, it was time to move on to extracting its configuration and to follow the sampleâ€™s code path to its persistence capabilities and initial beacon.
Figure 10: Deobfuscating dfsds.exe shows that the method begins with some path manipulation and then accesses Base64-encoded data Configuration, Persistence and Initial Beacon Recall that in Figure 10 we found that the method SchemaServerManager.
Main has a local variable containing Base64-encoded data; decoding that data revealed what it contains.
