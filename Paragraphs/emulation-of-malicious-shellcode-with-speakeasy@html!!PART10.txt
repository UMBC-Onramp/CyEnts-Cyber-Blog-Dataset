Speakeasy is designed to support arbitrary emulation engines in the future via an abstraction layer, but it currently relies on Unicorn.
Full OS sandboxing will likely always be required to analyze all samples as generically emulating all of Windows is somewhat unfeasible.
Sandboxing can be difficult to scale on demand and can be time consuming to run samples.
However, by making sure we emulate specific malware families, such as Beacon in this example, we can quickly reduce the need to reverse engineer variants.
Being able to generate high level triage reports in an automated fashion is often all the analysis that is needed on a malware variant.
This allows malware analysts more time to focus on samples that may require deeper analysis.
Shellcode or Windows PEs are loaded into the emulated address space.
Windows data structures required to facilitate basic emulation of Windows kernel mode and user mode are created before attempting to emulate the malware.
Processes, drivers, devices and user mode libraries are “faked” in order to present the malware with a realistic looking execution environment.
