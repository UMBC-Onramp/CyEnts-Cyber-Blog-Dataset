When an IMA policy is set to audit any executable and auditd is running, a log will be written containing metadata for each executable.
The simplest IMA policy we can write to log all executables looks like this: audit func=BPRM_CHECK mask=
MAY_EXEC There are several ways to apply this policy to IMA that are detailed in the IMA documentation.
Later versions of systemd will apply a custom policy located in “/etc/ima/ima-policy”.
Placing the single line policy set forth above in this file will cause systemd to apply this IMA policy to the system.
This version of systemd was included in Ubuntu 16.04.1.
It should be noted that the example policy is extremely broad and will result in a high volume of logs being generated, primarily by daemons – equivalent to a Windows service - performing routine tasks, such as systemd.
