We have analyzed the top 40 third-party ad libraries (not including Google Ads) used by Android apps.
Among the apps with over 100,000 downloads each on Google Play, over 42 percent of the free apps currently contain at least one of these top ad libraries.
The total download count of such apps now exceeds 12.4 billion.
From our analysis, at least 47 percent of these top 40 ad libraries have at least one version of their code in active use by popular apps on Google Play, and contain the JS-Binding-Over-HTTP vulnerability.
