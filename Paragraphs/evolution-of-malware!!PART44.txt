GandCrab later announced their retirement in June of 2019, after claiming to have netted $2 billion, most likely because they were feeling the heat of the authorities.
However, the GandCrab authors would later be loosely affiliated with the Sodonikibi and REvil threat actors, most notably as part of the infamous summer 2021 attack on Colonial Pipeline.
Other notable RaaS variants that have emerged since GandCrab are BlackCat, Conti, DarkSide, and Lockbit, to name a few.
Conclusion Between 1971 and early 2000, malware was mostly relegated to mischief and attempts by virus authors to see if something they had created would work.
Fast forward 20+ years, and we can see that the threat landscape has evolved from mischief to include profitable cybercrime and nation-state attacks.
Likewise, the evolution of the initial term “virus” to today’s all-encompassing “malware” reflects the evolution of threats over the past 20 years.
It is not coincidental that the development and changes of such attacks have coincided with the development of the hyper-connected world in which we now live.
As we embark on the next 25 years—thinking ahead for the 75 th anniversary of threats—we can only assume that threats will continue to target whatever technology or trends that are trending or topical.
Of course, it is much easier to forecast the next 12 months, as discussed in our recent “ Predictions for 2022:
Tomorrow’s Threats Will Target the Expanding Attack Surface ” blog.
Still, one thing remains clear, the biggest single risk will always be the human element.
