These two values are then stored in the contextâ€™s EIP and ESP variables respectively.
The r14 stack pointer is then incremented one more time to get the location where the __stdcall arguments are (remember stdcall passes all arguments on the stack).
This argument array is important for later, remember it.
The arguments pointer is moved into r11, so in C this means that r11 is equivalent to an array of stack slots where each slot is an argument uint32_t r11[argCount].
