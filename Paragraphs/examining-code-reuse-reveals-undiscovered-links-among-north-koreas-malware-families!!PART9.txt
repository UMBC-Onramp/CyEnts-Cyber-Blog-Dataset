WannaCry code comparison overview.
For our research we compared the three major variants of WannaCry.
An early release, called a beta, from February 2017, one from April, and the infamous one that hit the world in May.
Common file mapping The second example demonstrates code responsible for mapping a file and using the XOR key 0xDEADBEEF on the first four bytes of the file.
This code has appeared in the malware families NavRAT and Gold Dragon, plus a certain DLL from the South Korean gambling hacking campaign.
These three RATs are thought to be affiliated with North Koreaâ€™s Group 123.
NavRAT and the gambling DLL share more code, making them closer variants.
