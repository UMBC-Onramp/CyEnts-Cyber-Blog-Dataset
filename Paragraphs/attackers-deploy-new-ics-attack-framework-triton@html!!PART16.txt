Along with the executable, two binary files, inject.bin (malicious function code) and imain.bin (malicious control logic) , were deployed as the controller’s payload.
These file names were hard coded in the Py2EXE compiled python script.
Trilog.exe took one option from the command line, which was a single IP address of the target Triconex device.
It did not leverage the underlying TRITON library’s capability for Triconex device discovery, instead an instance of trilog.exe had to be invoked separately for each target controller in the environment.
