Malware Flow Diagram
The following diagram provides a full picture of the malware's execution.
Internally, SUNBURST uses a set of modes and transitions as described earlier.
The names of these modes and transitions have no meaning.
The malware authors purposely chose them as a form of obfuscation.
When diagraming the malware's execution, these names were reused for clarity.
Figure 4:
Malware logic and decision states Q&A Is a system running blocklisted processes, services, or drivers safe from compromise?
Sometimes, but not always.
SUNBURST unconditionally exits if blocklisted processes or drivers are found and will not run until they are no longer detected.
On the other hand, services are disabled by setting a registry value that controls startup initialization and are not explicitly stopped.
As a result, a blocklisted service may still be running when the malware performs its service checks later.
For this reason, it is possible for a victim system to be infected while a blocklisted service is running.
Additionally, SUNBURST only attempts to disable a service once and updates its configuration to mark the service as disabled.
Once the configuration is updated, the service is not treated as a blocklisted entry during subsequent execution.
