Glitching the Bootloader Based on previous research in this domain , we opted to target the data lines (I/O) between the MCU and NAND flash.
Recall from Part One that the NAND flash on the X2e was the Spansion S34ML01G1, which was a 63-pin ball grid array (BGA) package.
This chip is capable of supporting both 8-bit and 16-bit bus width, which corresponds to the number of I/O lines utilized.
