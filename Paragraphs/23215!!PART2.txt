Why use WhatsApp mods?
Not all users are happy with the official WhatsApp app.
Some may feel a need for self-destructing messages or, conversely, the ability to view messages another user deleted.
Others are after dynamic themes, and still others want to hide certain chats from the general list or automatically translate messages.
Naturally, they want these features right away, not when WhatsApp’s developers finally get around to implementing them.
As a result, some users turn to the modified WhatsApp clients available online, which are fairly numerous and not hard to find.
Fans of mods are not deterred even by WhatsApp’s occasional crackdown on such modifications or the threat of account bans.
The creators of WhatsApp mods often embed ads in them — understandably — along with the features users are looking for.
Problems arise, however, from their use of third-party ad modules through which malicious code can sneak in under developers’ radar.

In version 16.80.0 the developers use third-party ad module that includes a Trojan.
