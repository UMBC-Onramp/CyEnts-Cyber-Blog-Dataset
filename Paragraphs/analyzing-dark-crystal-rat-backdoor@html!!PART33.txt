As part of confirming our findings about Dark Crystal RAT capabilities that we obtained through reverse engineering, we found some YouTube demonstrations of the DCRat builder and server.
The YouTube user LIKAR has a YouTube demonstration of Dark Crystal RAT .
The author demonstrates use of the Dark Crystal RAT software on a server with two active RAT instances.
During the video, the author browses through the various screens in the software.
This made it easy to envision how a cyber threat would use the RAT, and to confirm our suspicions of how it works.
Figure 21 shows a capture from the video at 3:27 .
Note that the Dark Crystal RAT builder software refers to the DCRatBuild package as a “server” rather than a client.
Nonetheless, observe that one of the options was a type of Java, or C# (Beta).
By watching this YouTube video and doing some additional background research, we discovered that Dark Crystal RAT has existed for some time in a Java version.
