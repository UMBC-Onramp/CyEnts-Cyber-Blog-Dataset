Fine-tuning in particular presents a problem for blue\nteams, as it allows threat actors to better evade classifiers and\ndetection models that are built for pre-trained outputs.
This is\nworrisome as a would-be threat actorâ€™s fine-tuning datasets would\nlikely be private and unknown to the defender at test time.
