According to our data, the malware has hit users in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region — not so surprising given its malware-as-a-service (MaaS) distribution model, meaning anyone can buy it and the price is quite low (about $10 per month or roughly $40 for a “lifetime license”).
In addition to its theft functions, the malware has a set of tools meant to thwart analysis (read more about them here ).
It sends stolen information as a ZIP archive to the C&C server, which is protected against DDoS and other Web attacks.
The cybercriminals use either the (quite basic) control panel or Telegram to get the data, including gamer accounts.
Not by BloodyStealer alone BloodyStealer is just one of many tools available on the dark web for stealing gamer accounts.
Cybercriminals sell other types of malware, many of which have been on the market longer than BloodyStealer.
In addition, underground forums often feature ads offering to post a malicious link on a popular website or selling tools to generate phishing pages automatically.
