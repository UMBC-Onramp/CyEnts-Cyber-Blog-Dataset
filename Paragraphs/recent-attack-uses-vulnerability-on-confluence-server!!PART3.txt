Cryptojacking After exploiting CVE-2021-26084, it downloads init.sh from 86.105.195[.]120.
The shell is a crypto miner that includes following tasks: Delete syslog Change commonly used command Stop aliyun services and apparmor Set the path for miner execution file (zzh) and itself but rename as newinit.sh Kill all other miner processes Use crontab to establish persistence Get scanning shell (is.sh) Clean the trace In the scanning shell, it will try to download a scanning tool, like Masscan, Pnscan, etc, which can be used to scan and survey IPv4 TCP network in order to discover live host to proceed the spreading.
The downloader path is shown as below.
It also downloads a shell that defines specific steps for the scan.
First, get the login brute force tool hxx (md5: f0551696774f66ad3485445d9e3f7214) and account/password list ps (md5: a43ad8a740081f0b5a89e219fe8475a3), then scan the subnet belong to private network (172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8).
This is to allow the malware to login into more devices in victim’s intranet and spread miner script (init.sh).
