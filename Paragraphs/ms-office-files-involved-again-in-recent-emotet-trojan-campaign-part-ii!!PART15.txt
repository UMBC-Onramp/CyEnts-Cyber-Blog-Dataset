Thread-Module â€“ Submit Stolen Data With the functional modules working to steal sensitive data, the thread-module keeps monitoring the temporary file until it is created with the stolen information.
It then loads the stolen data from the temporary file to memory and then deletes the file.
Before submitting the stolen data to the C2 server, it compresses the data and encrypts it.
This example, shown in Figure 6.1, is where it was about to call the API BCryptEncrypt() to encrypt the packet, which begins from 4790E0.
