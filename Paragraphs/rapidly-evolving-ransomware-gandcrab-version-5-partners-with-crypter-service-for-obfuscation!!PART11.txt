A new registry entry to hold the random extension.
The malware tries creating this new entry in the root key of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
If it cannot—for example, because the user does not have admin rights—it places the entry in the root key HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
This entry is deleted in some samples after the files have been encrypted.
Version 5.0.1 This version fixed some internal bugs in the malware but made no other notable changes.
Version 5.0.2 This version changes the random extension length from 5 to 10 characters and fixes some internal bugs.
