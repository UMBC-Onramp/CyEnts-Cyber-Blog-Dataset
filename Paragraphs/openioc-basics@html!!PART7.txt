This is the content of the IOC, containing the artifacts that an investigator decided to codify in the IOC.
For example, these may include the MD5 of a file, a registry path or something found in process memory.
Inside the definition, indicators are listed out or combined into expressions that consist of two terms and some form of Boolean logic.
One thing about the OpenIOC format that makes it particularly useful is the ability to combine similar terms using Boolean AND & OR logic.
