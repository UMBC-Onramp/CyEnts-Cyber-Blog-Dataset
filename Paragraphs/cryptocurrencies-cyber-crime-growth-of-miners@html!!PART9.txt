In early April 2018, actor \"Mon£y\" was observed by FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence selling a Monero miner for $80 USD – payable via Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin, or Monero – that included unlimited builds, free automatic updates, and 24/7 support.
The tool, dubbed Monero Madness (Figure 3), featured a setting called Madness Mode that configures the miner to only run when the infected machine is idle for at least 60 seconds.
This allows the miner to work at its full potential without running the risk of being identified by the user.
According to the actor, Monero Madness also provides the following features: Unlimited builds Builder GUI (Figure 4) Written in AutoIT (no dependencies) FUD Safer error handling Uses most recent XMRig code Customizable pool/port Packed with UPX Works on all Windows OS (32- and 64-bit) Madness Mode option Figure 3:
