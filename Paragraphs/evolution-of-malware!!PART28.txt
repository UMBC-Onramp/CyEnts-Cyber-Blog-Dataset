Mytob was one of the first viruses to specifically block or work against anti-virus software by preventing connectivity from the victimsâ€™ machine to various update sites.
This was done by redirecting all known vendor URIs to 127.0.0.1, a localhost IP.
This caused all queries to public-facing websites to resolve to the machine itself, essentially going nowhere.
Mytob was very prolific for its time and was consistently listed at the top of Top 10 charts.
It had so many variants with different functionalities that anti-virus companies often had the entire alphabet appended to the malware name.
