Figure 5:
Information flow among Angry Birds, the ad intermediate platform and the ad cloud[/caption] First, we are concerned with the type of information transmitted to the advertisement library.
Figure 5 illustrates the information flow among Angry Birds, the Angry Birds Cloud, Burstly (the embedded ad library and ad mediation platform), and cloud-based ad services such as Jumptap and Millennial Media.
Angry Birds uses Burstly as an ad adapter, which provides integration with numerous third-party ad clouds including Jumptap and Millennial Media.
The ad services use playersâ€™ personal data to target ads.
As the figure shows, Angry Birds maintains an HTTP connection with the advertising platform Burstly, the advertisement provider Millennial Media, and more.
Traffic flow Table 1 summarizes the connections, which we explain in detail below.
