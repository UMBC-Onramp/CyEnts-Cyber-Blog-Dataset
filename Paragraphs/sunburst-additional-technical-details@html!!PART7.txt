Otherwise, execution stops and retries at a random later time.
Anti-Analysis Blocklists SUNBURST's behavior is affected by the presence of malware analysis and security software.
To disguise the strings used to detect these security tools, UNC2452 calculated and embedded a hash value for each string.
While it is trivial for the backdoor to check for the existence of a hashed process name, it is computationally expensive to determine what string a hash value corresponds to (the “preimage”).
However, thanks to some hard work by members of the information security community, the hashes have been successfully brute-forced.
