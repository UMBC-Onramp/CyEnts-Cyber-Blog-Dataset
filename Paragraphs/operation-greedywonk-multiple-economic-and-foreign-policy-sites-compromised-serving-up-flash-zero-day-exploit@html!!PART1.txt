Less than a week after uncovering Operation SnowMan , the FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence cloud has identified another targeted attack campaign — this one exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Flash.
We are collaborating with Adobe security on this issue.
Adobe has assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0502 to this vulnerability and released a security bulletin .
As of this blog post, visitors to at least three nonprofit institutions — two of which focus on matters of national security and public policy — were redirected to an exploit server hosting the zero-day exploit.
We’re dubbing this attack “Operation GreedyWonk.”
We believe GreedyWonk may be related to a May 2012 campaign outlined by ShadowServer, based on consistencies in tradecraft (particularly with the websites chosen for this strategic Web compromise), attack infrastructure, and malware configuration properties.
The group behind this campaign appears to have sufficient resources (such as access to zero-day exploits) and a determination to infect visitors to foreign and public policy websites.
The threat actors likely sought to infect users to these sites for follow-on data theft, including information related to defense and public policy matters.
