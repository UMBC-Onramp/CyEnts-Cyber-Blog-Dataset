IMPORT OF THE RSA PUBLIC BLOB FOR THE MALWARE DEVELOPERS
This key is protected with a crypto using a key of 32 bits and iv of 8 bytes using the function “CryptGenRandom” to avoid memory dumps but, later, it will need to be decrypted before use.
After this, the malware starts the procedure of crypting the files, searching in units, before importing the RSA public BLOB key generated in runtime.
After this, it creates the ransom note prepared for this infected machine in the root folder and then starts looking for folders and files to crypt.
