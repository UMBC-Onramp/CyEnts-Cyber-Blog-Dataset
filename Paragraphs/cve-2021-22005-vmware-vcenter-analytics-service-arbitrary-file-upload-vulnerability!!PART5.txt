Create a file in “/ tmp” to check for directory traversal Testing directory traversal Folder “ _ c_i” that was created in previous step is important to perform directory traversal , because the process will look for “_ c_i /.. /.. /.. /.. /.. /.. / tmp /” folder before writing the file “ test2.json” at destination location:
File created in /tmp
by directory traversal R emote C ode E xecution To achieve remote code execution and obtain a reverse shell, the following steps can be taken: On the victim’s server, create a cron job at “ /etc/cron.d/” using directory traversal.
Provide the appropriate payload to attain reverse shell as body of request.
On attacker machine, use nc to listen on port where we expect to get reverse shell from vCenter server.
