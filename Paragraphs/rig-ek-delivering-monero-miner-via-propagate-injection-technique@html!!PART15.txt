It then resets the callback for SetPropA, which was modified by malware during PROPagate injection.
Figure 17 shows the code snippet of the injected shellcode.
Figure 17:
Assembly view of injected shellcode Analysis of Third Stage Payload Before executing the malicious code, the malware performs anti-analysis checks to make sure no analysis tool is running in the system.
It creates two infinitely running threads that contain code to implement anti-analysis checks.
The first thread enumerates the processes using CreateToolhelp32Snapshot and checks for the process names generally used in analysis.
It generates a DWORD hash value from the process name using a custom operation and compares it with the array of hardcoded DWORD values.
If the generated value matches any value in the array, it terminates the corresponding process.
The second thread enumerates the windows using EnumWindows.
It uses GetClassNameA function to extract the class name associated with the corresponding window.
Like the first thread, it generates a DWORD hash value from the class name using a custom operation and compares it with the array of hardcoded DWORD values.
