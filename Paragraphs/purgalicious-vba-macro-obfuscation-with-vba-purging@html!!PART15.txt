Since these rules both turn up benign documents as well, they aren’t\nready for a production environment; however, they could be useful as\n“weak signals” for more manual threat hunting.
Many static detection\nengines may struggle for accuracy when identifying the VBA purging\ntechnique.

Conclusion For as long as companies use Office documents, attackers will be\ntrying to smuggle malicious macros into them.
VBA purging represents a\nrecent example of how threat actors continually invent new ways to\nevade defenders.
