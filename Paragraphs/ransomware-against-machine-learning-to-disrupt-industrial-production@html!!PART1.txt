Since at least 2017, there has been a significant increase in public disclosures of ransomware incidents impacting industrial production and critical infrastructure organizations.
Well-known ransomware families like WannaCry, LockerGoga, MegaCortex, Ryuk, Maze, and now SNAKEHOSE (a.k.a.
Snake / Ekans), have cost victims across a variety of industry verticals many millions of dollars in ransom and collateral costs.
These incidents have also resulted in significant disruptions and delays to the physical processes that enable organizations to produce and deliver goods and services.
While lots of information has been shared about the victims and immediate impacts of industrial sector ransomware distribution operations, the public discourse continues to miss the big picture.
