Mandiant has seen an uptick in incidents involving Microsoft 365 (M365) and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Most of these incidents are the result of a phishing email coercing a user to enter their credentials used for accessing M365 into a phishing site.
Other incidents have been a result of password spraying, password stuffing, or simple brute force attempts against M365 tenants.
In almost all of these incidents, the user or account was not protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA).
These opportunistic attacks are certainly the most common form of compromise for M365 and Azure AD, and are usually the initial vector to establish persistence.
During both incident response (IR) engagements and proactive cloud assessments we are often asked: What are some other types of attacks that Mandiant is seeing against M365 and Azure AD?
