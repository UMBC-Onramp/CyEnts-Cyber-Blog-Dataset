The figure below shows a sequence of commands that the SORA Mirai variant executes immediately after gaining access to a device.
These strings have been heavily used by researchers over time to classify variants.
However, there are cases where variants may use different tokens but turn out to be the same malware function-wiseâ€”and are even operated by the same threat actor.
In such cases, analyzing the actual binary being downloaded into the device would greatly help further define the number of existing variants.
Based on the attacks received by the honeypot, the following table shows the top 10 variants we were able to identify.
