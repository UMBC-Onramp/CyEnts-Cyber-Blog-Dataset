This complicates the theory of \"ground up\" development, so did they base their code on something else?
While learning from the TriStation functionality within TRITON, we continued to explore legitimate TriStation software.
We began our search for \"TS1131.exe\" and hit dead ends sorting through TriStation DLLs until we came across a variety of TriStation utilities in MSI form.
We ultimately stumbled across a juicy archive containing \"Trilog v4.\" Upon further inspection, this file installed \"TriLog.exe,\" which the original TRITON executable mimicked, and a couple of supporting DLLs, all of which were timestamped around August 2006.
When we saw the DLL file description \"Tricon Communications Interface\" and original file name \"TricCom.DLL\", we knew we were in the right place.
