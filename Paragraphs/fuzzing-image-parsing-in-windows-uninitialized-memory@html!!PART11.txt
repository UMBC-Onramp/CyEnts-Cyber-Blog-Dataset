After spending quite a bit of time debugging the trace, I found the source of uninitialized memory in windowscodecs!CFormatConverter::Initialize .
Even though the source was found, it was not initially clear why this memory ends up in the calculation of pixels without getting overwritten at all.
To solve this mystery, additional debugging was done by comparing PoC execution trace against a normal TIFF file decoding.
