Service tickets are used to authenticate a user to a specific service hosted on a system.
A valid TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Key Distribution Center (KDC).
In Active Directory environments, the KDC is hosted on a Domain Controller.
The diagram in Figure 1 shows the authentication flow.
