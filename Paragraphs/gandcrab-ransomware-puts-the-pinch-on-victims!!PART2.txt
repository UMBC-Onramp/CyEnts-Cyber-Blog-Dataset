The hack was confirmed by the malware author in a Russian forum: Figure 1.
Confirmation by the author of the hack of GandCrab servers.
The text apologizes to partners for the hack and temporarily shuts down the program.
It promises to release an improved version within a few days.
The second version of GandCrab quickly appeared and improved the malware serverâ€™s security against future counterattacks.
The first versions of the ransomware had a list of file extensions to encrypt, but the second and later versions have replaced this list with an exclusion list.
All files except those on the list were encrypted.
Old versions of the malware used RSA and AES to encrypt the files, and communicated with a control server to send the RSA keys locked with an RC4 algorithm.
