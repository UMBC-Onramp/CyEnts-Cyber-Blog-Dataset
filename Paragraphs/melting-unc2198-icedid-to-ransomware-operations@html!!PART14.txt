TTR is not a perfect quantification, as external factors such as an organizationâ€™s security posture can drastically affect the measurement.
In this post, the TTR of UNC2198 is measured between ICEDID activity to the deployment of ransomware.
In July 2020, UNC2198 deployed MAZE ransomware using PSEXEC, and the TTR was 5.5 days.
In October 2020, UNC2198 deployed EGREGOR ransomware using forced GPO updates, and the TTR was 1.5 days.
Looking Forward Threat actors leveraging access obtained through mass malware campaigns to deploy ransomware is a growing trend.
