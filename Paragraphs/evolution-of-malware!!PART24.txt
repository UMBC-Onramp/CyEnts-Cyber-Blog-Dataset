This gave rise to record-breaking worm and wormlike attacks.
On August 11, 2003, Blaster (also known as MSBlast and lovesan) was launched.
Home users and workers at large organizations were shocked when their machines suddenly experienced the dreaded “Blue Screen of Death” (BSOD) and rebooted.
What they didn’t know was that they had been disrupted by the Blaster worm.
Blaster targeted a remote procedure call (RPC) vulnerability in Microsoft Windows XP and 2003 operating systems to propagate worldwide.
The worm's goal was to perform a SYN flood attack against windowsupdate.com to prevent machines from accessing updates.
Luckily for Microsoft, the author made the mistake of directing Blaster to the wrong domain.
The windowsupdate.com domain was nonessential as machines instead used windowsupdate.microsoft.com to receive their updates.
