In February 2021, we saw the botnet remove the minexmr mining pool and only use f2pool.
Then, in March 2021, Juniper Threat Labs noticed a significant uptick in activity, as recorded by our sensors.
In addition to incorporating more exploits, the botnet now combines the worm and the miner into a single binary.
Our researchers believe the threat actor will have better control and management with a single binary as the binary is constantly updated.
Sysrv also added nanopool as a new mining pool.
We also identified new development in the loader script where it tries to add ssh keys to infected system.
