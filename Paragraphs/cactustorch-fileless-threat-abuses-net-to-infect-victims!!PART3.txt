The only component created is the output JavaScript file, which is executed on the target system by the script host (wscript.exe).
For our analysis, we ran some basic deobfuscation and found CactusTorch , which had been hidden by some online tools: Figure 2:
CactusTorch code.
Before we dive into this code, we need to understand .NET
and its COM exposure.
When we install the .NET framework on any system, several .NET libraries are exposed via Microsoftâ€™s Component Object Model (COM).

FromBase64Transform.
If we look at the exposed interfaces, we can see IDispatch, which allows the COM object to be accessed from the script host or a browser.

To execute malicious code using the DotNetToJScript vector, an attack uses the following COM objects: Text.
