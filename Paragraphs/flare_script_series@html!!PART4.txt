Approach The first task is to find the string decoder function and get a basic understanding of the inputs and outputs of the function.
The next task is to identify each time the string decoder function is called and all of the arguments to each call.
Without using IDA, a handy Python project for binary analysis is Vivisect .
Vivisect contains several heuristics for identifying functions and cross-references.
Additionally, Vivisect can emulate and disassemble a series of opcodes, which can help us identify function arguments.
If you havenâ€™t already, be sure to check out the FLARE scripting series post on tracking function arguments using emulation , which also uses Vivisect.
