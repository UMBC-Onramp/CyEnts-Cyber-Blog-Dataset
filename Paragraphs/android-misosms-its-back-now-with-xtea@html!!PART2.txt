The new variant also abandons SMTP email as the transport method.
It now handles all CnC communication natively in C++, making it harder for an analyst to analyze the malware by disassembling its ARM code.
The newer version also hard codes specific public DNS servers such as the following: resolver1.opendns.com
nscache.prserv.com resolver1.qwest.net resolver2.opendns.com google-public-dns-b.google.com google-public-dns-a.google.com mx1.oray.net.cn 183.136.132.176 183.136.132.170
The new MisoSMS attempts to resolve its CnC domain name(puk[dot]nespigt[dot]iego[dot]net) from one of these DNS servers.
In this way, MisoSMS stays quiet in sandbox environments, which typically use internal DNS servers and cut off access to outside networks.
If the malware cannot access the hard-coded DNS servers, it does nothing and is therefore not detected.
