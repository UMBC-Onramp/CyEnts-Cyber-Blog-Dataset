The only pure Python ESE database implementation we identified was part of the Impacket network toolset.
Although the source code could perform basic database enumeration, it lacked key features, including the ability to process long values.
Since the QMGR database includes entries large enough to require long values, modification of the Impacket implementation was required.
We adapted the Impacket ESE database parsing code to make it more robust and support all features necessary for parsing QMGR databases.
