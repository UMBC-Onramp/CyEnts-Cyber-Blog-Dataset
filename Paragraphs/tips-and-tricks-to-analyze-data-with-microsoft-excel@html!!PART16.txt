This Excel formula counts how many times a value exists in a range of cells.
$B$2:$B2
This is the range of cells, B2 through B2, that we want to start with.
Since we want to increase our range as we go through the rows of the log data, the ending cell row number (2 in this example) is not made absolute.
As we fill this formula down through the rest of our log data, it will automatically expand the range to include the current log record and all previous logs.
