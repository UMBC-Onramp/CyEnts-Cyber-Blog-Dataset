Once the build completes, visit the bin directory and copy kscldr.exe to your debug target.
Before you can commence using your custom copy of this tool, you’ll need to follow just a few more steps to prepare the target system to allow it.
Preparing the Debug Target To debug kernel shellcode, I wrote a Windows software-only driver that loads and runs shellcode at privilege level 0.
Normally, Windows only loads drivers that are signed with a special cross-certificate , but Windows allows you to enable testsigning to load drivers signed with a test certificate.
We can create this test certificate for free, and it won’t allow the driver to be loaded on production systems, which is ideal.
