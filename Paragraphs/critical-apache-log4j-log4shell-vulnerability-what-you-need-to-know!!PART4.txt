The Log4j framework provides an interface with the JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface), which allows a connection to an external directory service such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
This forms the basis of several exploitation attempts currently seen in the wild, whereby insecure JNDI lookups potentially allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
Interestingly, the initial exploit leveraging CVE-2021-44228 appears to have been created before the patch was released.
According to Cloudflare , the exploit was found as early as December 1 st , nine days before the patch release.
