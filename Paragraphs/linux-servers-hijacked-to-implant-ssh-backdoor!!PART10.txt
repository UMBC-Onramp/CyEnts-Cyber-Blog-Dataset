( The decom piled code is functionally identical to the Gameboy routine, differing only due to loop-unrolling and other compiler optimizations . )
While the underlying encryption routine is taken directly from publicly available code , the malware authors incorporate some additional tricks to thwart analysis and decryption.
Both Blowfish and the Nintendo variant require a n S-box lookup table that remains constant throughout the encryption and decryption processes.
But u nlike the Nintendo implementation , the malware mutate s its S-box prior to use.
First, as the table is loaded from program memory, it is subject to several static transformations that make it harder to correlate the stored table with the one used for encryption.
