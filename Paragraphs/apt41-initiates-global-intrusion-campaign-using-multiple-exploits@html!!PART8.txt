Cisco PSIRT confirmed that fixed software to address the noted vulnerabilities is available and asks customers to review the following security advisories and take appropriate action: Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Information Disclosure Vulnerability Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Command Injection Vulnerability Exploitation of CVE-2020-10189 (Zoho ManageEngine Zero-Day Vulnerability)
On March 5, 2020, researcher Steven Seeley , published an advisory and released proof-of-concept code for a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central versions prior to 10.0.474 ( CVE-2020-10189) .
Beginning on March 8, FireEye observed APT41 use 91.208.184[.]78 to attempt to exploit the Zoho ManageEngine vulnerability at more than a dozen FireEye customers, which resulted in the compromise of at least five separate customers.
FireEye observed two separate variations of how the payloads (install.bat and storesyncsvc.dll) were deployed.
In the first variation the CVE-2020-10189 exploit was used to directly upload “logger.zip”, a simple Java based program, which contained a set of commands to use PowerShell to download and execute install.bat and storesyncsvc.dll.
