To communicate with SIS controllers, attackers recoded the proprietary TriStation communication protocol on port UDP/1502.
This step suggests they invested the time to reverse engineer the Triconex product.
Nozomi Networks has created a Wireshark dissector that is very handy for analyzing the TriStation protocol and detecting a Triton attack.
The following screenshot shows an example of the information returned by the Triconex SIS.
Triton requires the “running state” of the controller to perform the next stages of the attack.
In the preceding screen Triconex replies to the request “Get Control Program Status,” which is sent by Triton.
The Triton framework (dc81f383624955e0c0441734f9f1dabfe03f373c) posed as the legitimate executable trilog.exe, which collects logs.
The executable is a python script compiled in an exe.
The framework also contains library.zip (1dd89871c4f8eca7a42642bf4c5ec2aa7688fd5c), which contains all the python scripts required by Triton.
