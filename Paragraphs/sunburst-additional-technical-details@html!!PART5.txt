It repurposes two existing settings in the appSettings section: ReportWatcherRetry and ReportWatcherPostpone .
During initialization, the backdoor determines if the ReportWatcherRetry setting is the value 3 .
This value indicates the malware has been deactivated and will no longer perform any network activity.
As we describe later, UNC2452 can command the backdoor to disable itself.
This feature may be utilized when the operator determines the victim is not of interest or that theyâ€™ve completed their mission.
When investigating a system compromised by SUNBURST, review this setting to determine if the backdoor has been disabled.
Note, the presence of this value does not offer proof the actor did not further compromise the environment before disabling SUNBURST.
