(We did spend some time attempting to virtualize the WemoAppâ€”with no success.)
Bypassing the root password From the extracted file system, we learned the Wemo runs the embedded Linux system OpenWRT, with the user account information held in either the standard /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files.
We extracted the hash for the root password from /etc/passwd and submitted it to a cracking rig.
This method proved ineffective in a reasonable amount of time.
With our ability to read the flash chip we had a good chance to write to the chip.
Barring any checksum or validations done on the firmware, we might be able to replace the /etc/passwd file with a known password.
To test this theory, we would have to repack the firmware.
Since the GPL for the Wemo is public, we chose to use the same tools used by the developers.
