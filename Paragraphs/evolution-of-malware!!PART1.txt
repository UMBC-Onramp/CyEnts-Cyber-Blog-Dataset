A “computer virus” is one of the few transcendent technical terms everyone understands, including children.
Regardless of socioeconomic background or age, everyone has an immediate negative connotation to that term.
It is usually associated with something destructive to the technology we all rely on, whether it’s a laptop, smartphone, application, or gaming system, demonstrating how ubiquitous computers and technology have become in our daily lives.
Part of the reason is that we have all been exposed to the impact of viruses, such as the flu or the common cold.
And like its biological counterparts, a computer virus also replicates and can be transmitted from one host to another, creating problems ranging from annoying to downright destructive.
