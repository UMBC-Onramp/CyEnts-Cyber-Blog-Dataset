Q. Is there any nation state involvement?
At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support the involvement of any nation state.
Based on the relative lack of sophistication of the code, however, it seems unlikely that a nation state is behind the malware.
Q: Is there anything note-worthy about the malware?
The malware has one interesting trick up its sleeve to deter researchersâ€”it checks to see whether its own code has been modified.
