Adobe Flash is one of the most exploited software components of the last decade.
Its complexity and ubiquity make it an obvious target for attackers.
Public sources list more than one thousand CVEs being assigned to the Flash Player alone since 2005.
Almost nine hundred of these vulnerabilities have a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of nine or higher.
After more than a decade of playing cat and mouse with the attackers, Adobe is finally deprecating Flash in 2020.
To the security community this move is not a surprise since all major browsers have already dropped support for Flash.
A common misconception exists that Flash is already a thing of the past; however, history has shown us that legacy technologies linger for quite a long time.
If organizations do not phase Flash out in time, the security threat may grow beyond Flash's end of life due to a lack of security patches.
As malware analysts on the FLARE team, we still see Flash exploits within malware samples.
We must find a compromise between the need to analyse Flash samples and the correct amount of resources to be spent on a declining product.
To this end we developed FLASHMINGO , a framework to automate the analysis of SWF files.
FLASHMINGO enables analysts to triage suspicious Flash samples and investigate them further with minimal effort.
It integrates into various analysis workflows as a stand-alone application or can be used as a powerful library.
