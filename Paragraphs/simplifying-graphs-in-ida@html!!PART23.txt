Functions with infinite loops do not have terminal nodes, and are not currently handled.
For a simple example, consider the graph in Figure 14.
It has the following immediate dominator and post-dominator trees: Figure 14:
Example graph Node idom 0
None 1 0 2 1 3 1 4 3 5 3 6 3 7 6 8 0 Node ipdom 0 8 1 3 2 3 3 6 4 6 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 None Looking for pairs of (idom[i] == j) and (ipdom[j] == i) gives the following: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 6) (6,7) (0, 8) is filtered because it makes up all of the nodes of the graph.
(1,3) and (6, 7) are filtered out because they contain nodes reachable from nodes not in the set: for (1, 3) node 2 is reachable from node 6, and for (6, 7) node 2 is reachable from node 1.
This leaves (3, 6) as the only isolate subgraph in this example, shown in Figure 15.
