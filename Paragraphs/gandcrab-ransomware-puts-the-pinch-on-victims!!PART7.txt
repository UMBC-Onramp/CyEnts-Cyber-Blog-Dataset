Without the new RSA private key, we cannot decrypt the Salsa20 key and IV that are appended to the file.
Finally, the ransomware deletes all shadow volumes on the infected machine and deletes itself.
Version 4.1 This version retains the Salsa20 algorithm, fixes some bugs, and adds a new function.
This function, in a random procedure from a big list of domains, creates a final path and sends the encrypted information gathered from the infected machine.
We do not know why the malware does this; the random procedure usually creates paths to remote sites that do not exist.
For example, one sample of this version has the following hardcoded list of encrypted domains.
(This is only a small part of this list.)
The ransomware selects one domain from the list and creates a random path with one of these words: Later it randomly chooses another word to add to the URL it creates: Afterward it makes a file name, randomly choosing three or four combinations from the following list: Finally the malware concatenates the filename with a randomly chosen extension: At this point, the malware sends the encrypted information using POST to the newly generated URL for all domains in the embedded list, repeating the process of generating a path and name for each domain.
