As with other filesystem and data formats, deleted entries are not immediately overwritten and can often be recovered for some time after deletion.
The following algorithm is used to recover deleted jobs and files from Windows 10 QMGR databases: Locate file records by searching for the file identifier GUID, {519ECFE4-D946-4397-B73E-268513051AB2}.
Attempt to parse the following data as a normal file record.
Locate job records by searching for job identifier GUIDs.
Attempt to parse the following data as a normal job record.
Handle incomplete job entries by parsing just the control structure and manually locate associated files if required.
The following job GUIDs have been observed in QMGR databases: {E10956A1-AF43-42C9-92E6-6F9856EBA7F6} {4CD4959F-7064-4BF2-84D7-476A7E62699F} {A92619F1-0332-4CBF-9427-898818958831} {DDBC33C1-5AFB-4DAF-B8A1-2268B39D01AD} {8F5657D0-012C-4E3E-AD2C-F4A5D7656FAF} {94416750-0357-461D-A4CC-5DD9990706E4} Correlate carved file records to carved jobs.
