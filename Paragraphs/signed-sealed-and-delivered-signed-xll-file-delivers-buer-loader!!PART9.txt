This is a newer variant of Buer loader that has been completely rewritten, as first pointed out by ProofPoint in May of 2021.
A deeper dive reveals that it was written in RUST and uses RUST crates/libraries, which explains the file size anomaly versus traditional malware.
Consistent with the latest version of Buer Loader, this version was observed incorporating the whoami ( https://github.com/libcala/whoami ) RUST crate, which allows for details such as current user info including username, full name, preferred language, OS name/version, and environment it is located in.
The version used is whoami-1.1.1, which was released on 2021-03-13 ( https://github.com/libcala/whoami/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md ) One interesting component of RUST are toolchains.
