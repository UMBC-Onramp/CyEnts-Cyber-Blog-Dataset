This variant of Snake Keylogger changes both the values of “Startup” to other folders.
Figure 3.2 shows the code changing the Windows startup folder to “C:\\Users\\M0YTes0Env\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\chsg\\” by calling the API SetValue().
In the bottom half of Figure 3.2 you can see the content of the system registry path, value name, and new value data.
“chsg” is a new folder created by Snake Keylogger.
The program copies the Snake Keylogger file (the downloaded \"Wheahmnfpgaqse.exe\") into this folder and renames it as “sgosr.exe”.
