LinuxFlushDnsCommand :
Specifies the command to flush the DNS resolver cache.
When using FakeNet-NG in SingleHost mode on Linux, this ensures that name resolution requests are forwarded to a DNS service such as the FakeNet-NG DNS listener instead of using cached answers.
The setting is not applicable on all distributions of Linux, but is populated by default with the correct command for Ubuntu Linux.
Refer to your distribution’s documentation for the proper command for this behavior.
Starting FakeNet-NG on Linux Before using FakeNet-NG, also be sure to disable any services that may bind to ports corresponding to the FakeNet-NG listeners you plan to use.
An example is Ubuntu’s use of a local dnsmasq service.
You can use netstat to find such services and should refer to your Linux distribution’s documentation to determine how to disable them.
You can start FakeNet-NG by invoking fakenet with root privileges, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Starting FakeNet-NG on Linux You can alter FakeNet-NG’s configuration by either directly editing the file displayed in the first line of FakeNet-NG’s output, or by creating a copy and specifying its location with the -c command-line option.
