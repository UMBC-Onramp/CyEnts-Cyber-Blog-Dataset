Rather, the compromises appear to be driven by threat actors who are motivated to achieve ideological, egotistical, or financial objectives by taking advantage of an ample supply of internet-connected OT systems.
As the actors are not interested in causing specific physical outcomes, they target whatever is available on the internet.
Mandiant has observed an increase in compromises of internet-accessible OT assets over the past several years.
In this blog post we discuss previously undisclosed compromises and place them in context alongside publicly known incidents.

The most common activity we observe involves actors trying to make money off exposed OT systems, but we also see actors simply sharing knowledge and expertise.
