The new malware families, which we will examine later in this post, show APT34 relying on their PowerShell development capabilities, as well as trying their hand at Golang.
APT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at least 2014.
They use a mix of public and non-public tools to collect strategic information that would benefit nation-state interests pertaining to geopolitical and economic needs.
APT34 aligns with elements of activity reported as OilRig and Greenbug, by various security researchers.
