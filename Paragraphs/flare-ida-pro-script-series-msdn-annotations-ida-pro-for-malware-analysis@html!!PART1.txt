The FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE)
Team continues to share knowledge and tools with the community.
We started this blog series with a script for Automatic Recovery of Constructed Strings in Malware .
As always, you can download these scripts at the following location: https://github.com/fireeye/flare-ida .
We hope you find all these scripts as useful as we do.
Motivation During my summer internship with the FLARE team, my goal was to develop IDAPython plug-ins that speed up the reverse engineering workflow in IDA Pro.
While analyzing malware samples with the team, I realized that a lot of time is spent looking up information about functions, arguments, and constants at the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) website.
Frequently switching to the developer documentation can interrupt the reverse engineering process, so we thought about ways to integrate MSDN information into IDA Pro automatically.
In this blog post we will release a script that does just that, and we will show you how to use it.
