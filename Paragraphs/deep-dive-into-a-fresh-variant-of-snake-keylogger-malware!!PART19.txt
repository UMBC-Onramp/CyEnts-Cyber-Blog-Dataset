Conclusion on Snake Keylogger
Malware In order to better understand the entire process of this malware, I drew a flow chart in Figure 6.1 that outlines the main steps explained in this analysis.
At the beginning of this analysis, we went through how a malicious Macro inside an Excel document executes PowerShell that downloads the Snake Keylogger's downloader.
Next, I focused more on how the Snake Keylogger installer performs persistence on the victim's device and the complicated, tricky way it extracts the payload of Snake Keylogger.
I then elaborated on the features this variant of Snake Keylogger offers, like recording keystrokes, collecting credentials data, clipboard data, and screenshots.
