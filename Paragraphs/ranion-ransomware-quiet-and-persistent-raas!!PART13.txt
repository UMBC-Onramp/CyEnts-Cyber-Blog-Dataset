As Ranion is more suited for beginner threat actors, the lack of sophistication in their ransomware delivery might be a reason why Ranion has not gained household status in the ransomware realm.
This may also be why they have managed to stay under the radar for more than four years.
Ranion’s ransom message supports eight languages by default (English, Russian, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and Persian).
Any regions in which those languages are primarily used can be a target of Ranion.
Ranion Ransomware Origin: HiddenTear Copycat?
Ranion bases its code on the open-source proof-of-concept ransomware known as HiddenTear.
 There are some code similarities between the two projects.
The above screenshot is from HiddenTear’s implantation of an encryption function.
 It can be found at https://github.com/goliate/hidden-tear/blob/master/hidden-tear/hidden-tear/Form1.cs .
 For comparison, Ranion’s implementation is below: To encrypt files, HiddenTear uses this function.
Ranion implements its encryption in a similar fashion.
These are just two examples.
Overall programming resemblance can be seen in a variety places.
In addition, Ranion kept their resource section similar to HiddenTear’s as well.
NOTE:
This Ranion variant is from 2017 and has a SHA256 hash value of eed03a9564aee24a68b2cade89d7fbe9929e95751a9fde4539c7896fda6bdcb5 To Be FFFFUUUUDDDD To be fully undetectable, the Ranion team has consistently relied on the ConfuserEx project, which is the successor of the now defunct Confuser project.
It is a free and open-source obfuscator that makes malware harder to analyze by “protecting” .NET
applications through symbol renaming, anti-debugging, encryption, compression, and other functions.
