However in the case of this Locky ransomware, the program does not exit (Figure 6) and the value received as a command line parameter is added to a constant value defined in the binary.
The sum of the constant and the parameter value is used in the decryption routine (Figure 7).
If no command line parameter is passed, it adds zero to the constant.
Figure 6.
Command line parameter check Figure 7.
Decryption routine
If no command line parameter is passed, then the constant for the decryption routine is incorrect.
