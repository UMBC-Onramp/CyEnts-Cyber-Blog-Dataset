This would remove a statement like “here is how you can #exploit tax loopholes” from being confused with a cyber security-related discussion about a user exploiting a software vulnerability as a malicious tool.
Second, a forecasting model scores the vulnerability based on whether annotators perceived the threat to be severe.
CVSS Forecasting Results Both the relevancy classifier and the severity classifier were applied to various datasets.
Data was collected from December 2017 to July 2018.
Most notably 1,000 tweets were held-out from the original 6,000 to be used for the relevancy classifier and 466 tweets were held-out for the severity classifier.
To measure the performance, we use the Area Under the precision-recall Curve (AUC), which is a correctness score that summarizes the tradeoffs of minimizing the two types of errors (false positive vs false negative), with scores near 1 indicating better performance.
