When you ask Cortana about “PS1,” you will be presented with your indexed PowerShell scripts.
A right click will allow you to “open file location” or “copy full path,” but with no means of execution.
If you click on the file as we already mentioned, the file will open in edit mode.
Curiously, it will not open the default editor (PowerShell ISE) for PowerShell scripts; instead, it will open the script in notepad.
We assume this was intended as a security measure because notepad cannot execute scripts, unlike PowerShell ISE.
