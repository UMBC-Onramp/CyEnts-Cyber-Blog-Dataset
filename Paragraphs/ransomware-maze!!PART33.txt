In January 2020 a new version of the malware appeared with a special text dedicated to some researchers in the security field.
The malware developers appear to have chosen those individuals to be provocative and make fun of them.
The sample was discovered by malwrhunterteam [9] on the 28th of January 2020.
The sample has some differences when compared with the previous one that was analyzed in this report.
Those differences will be covered later via another sample that was found by Luca Nagy [10] on the 30th of January 2020.
