At one victim, we observed UNC1945 moving laterally via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to a Windows server before viewing the Server Manager Panel, viewing and modifying RDP-related system firewall rules and checking the application settings of two endpoint security services.
Internal Reconnaissance Mandiant investigations found that the threat actor maintains various tools to interact with victim networks.
In addition to custom tools, the UNC1945 VMs contained various tools (e.g. network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance; see Associated Tools and Malware section).
In some intrusions, UNC1945 employed a SPARC executable identified as a reconnaissance tool.
Based on publicly available information, this executable could be referred to as Luckscan or BlueKeep, the latter of which is part of the BKScan toolkit (see Figure 6).

According to open sources, BlueKeep, aka “bkscan” scanner , works both unauthenticated and authenticated (i.e. when Network Level Authentication is enabled).
