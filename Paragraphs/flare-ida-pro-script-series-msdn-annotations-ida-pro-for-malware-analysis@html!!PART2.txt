Introduction The MSDN Annotations plug-in integrates information about functions, arguments and return values into IDA Pro’s disassembly listing in the form of IDA comments.
This allows the information to be integrated as seamlessly as possible.
Additionally, the plug-in is able to automatically rename constants, which further speeds up the analyst workflow.
The plug-in relies on an offline XML database file, which is generated from Microsoft’s documentation and IDA type library files.
