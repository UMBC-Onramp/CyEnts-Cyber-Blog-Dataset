In July 2020, Mandiant Threat Intelligence released a public report detailing an ongoing influence campaign we named “Ghostwriter.”
Ghostwriter is a cyber-enabled influence campaign which primarily targets audiences in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland and promotes narratives critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) presence in Eastern Europe.
Since releasing our public report, we have continued to investigate and report on Ghostwriter activity to Mandiant Intelligence customers.
We tracked new incidents as they happened and identified activity extending back years before we formally identified the campaign in 2020.
A new report by our Information Operations analysis, Cyber Espionage analysis, and Mandiant Research teams provides an update on Ghostwriter , highlighting two significant developments.
