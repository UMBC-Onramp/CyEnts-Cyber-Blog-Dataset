When executives have information on each asset’s value coupled with the attack flow information, they have all that’s needed to make a “threat-informed” decision about which of their defenses should be fortified first.
Value in Knowing the Potential Outcomes Using the same data, cyber-defense teams will be able to quickly know for instance: If 90% of the attacks follow a specific path of techniques, they will then be able to move more quickly to identify the attack path taken on an active investigation.
This ability will be possible after we have an extensive dataset of attack flows to examine and do data analysis on the attack flow corpus.
