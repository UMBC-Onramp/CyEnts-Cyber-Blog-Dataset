The sample begins by retrieving all auth servers via the API AuthAdmin::getAllAuthServers .
and logs the results.
Next, the sample logs all roles via the API DSRole::GeneralAdmin::getRoles and writes the values to the file.
The sample may also retrieve and log additional information depending on the device configuration.
HARDPULSE The file compcheckjava.cgi (SHA256: 1d3ab04e21cfd40aa8d4300a359a09e3b520d39b1496be1e4bc91ae1f6730ecc ) has the ability to read and write arbitrary files and may execute arbitrary commands depending on the implementation of a particular library function.
The sample responds to HTTP GETs and PUTs.
The GET path is not relevant, but the PUT path first checks if the incoming requests checkcode POST param is equal to a hardcoded passcode.
If this check passes the sample inspects the param hashid to determine if it's non-empty.
If non-empty the sample displays a prompt to the user that includes hardware information and then base64 decodes the param hashid and checks it against pulsesecure.
If this matches a recoveryToken is generated which is the MD5 hash of 16 random bytes, with the result hash truncated to 8 characters.
This token is then displayed to the user via the URL https://ive-host/dana-na/auth/recover[.]cgi?token=<varies> and the sample exits.
