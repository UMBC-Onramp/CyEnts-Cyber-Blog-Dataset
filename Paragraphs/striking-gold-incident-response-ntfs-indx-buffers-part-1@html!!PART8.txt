Mandiant Intelligent Response ® The Mandiant Intelligent Response ® (MIR) agent v.2.2 has the ability to extract INDX records natively.
To generate a list of INDX buffers in MIR, run a RAW file audit.
One of the options in the audit is to \"Parse NTFS INDX Buffers\".
You can run this recursively, or you can target specific directories.
We recommend the latter because this option will generate numerous entries when done recursively.
To display a list of parsed INDX buffers, you can filter a file listing in MIR by choosing the \"FileAttributes\" are \"like\" \"*INDX*\".
