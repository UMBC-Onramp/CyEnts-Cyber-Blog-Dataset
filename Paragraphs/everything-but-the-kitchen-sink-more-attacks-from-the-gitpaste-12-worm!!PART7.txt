Victim IP address being uploaded to Pastebin The backdoor is implemented by a UPX-packed binary “ss”, also written in Go, with variations compiled for Windows and multiple Linux architectures.
This program first determines the hijacked computer’s external IP address from myexternalip.com, uploads that address as the name of a private Pastebin paste, then starts TCP listeners on ports 30004 and 30006.
In addition to the known vulnerabilities above, X10-unix attempts to connect to Android Debug Bridge connections on port 5555.
