The FakeUpdates campaign begins with a rather intricate sequence of browser validation, performed before the final payload is downloaded.
Injected code on the initial compromised page will make the user’s browser transparently navigate to a malicious website using hard-coded parameters.
After victim browser information is gleaned, additional redirects are performed and the user is prompted to download a fake browser update.
FireEye has observed that the browser validation sequence may have additional protections to evade sandbox detections and post-incident triage attempts on the compromise site(s).
