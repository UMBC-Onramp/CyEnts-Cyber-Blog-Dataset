The web version of Amazon requires the user to complete a CAPTCHA after ten incorrect password attempts (Figure 1), to prevent password cracking.
However, Amazon’s mobile apps haven’t adopted such protection using CAPTCHA (Figure 2 and Figure 3).
This design flaw provides attackers the chance to crack any Amazon account’s password using brute force.

Furthermore, Amazon doesn’t have a strong password strength requirement.
It accepts commonly used weak passwords such as \"123456\" and \"111111\".
We know that the weaker the password, the easier for hackers to break into an account.
Therefore, allowing weak passwords puts account safety to potential security risks.
Given that there are many well-known previous password leakages , attackers can use these password leakages as knowledge bases to conduct password cracking.
As a proof of concept, we figured out the password of one Amazon account we setup within 1000 attempts, using the latest version (2.8.0) of Amazon’s Android shopping client.
