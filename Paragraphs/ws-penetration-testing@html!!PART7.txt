Some internal\npenetration tests can be done remotely via a VPN connection, but we\nrecommend conducting them at your location whenever possible.
If\nyour internal network has segmentation in place (as we recommend),\nthen you should work with your penetration testing organization to\ndetermine the best physical location for the test to be performed.\nGenerally, you'll want to do the internal penetration test from a\nnetwork segment that has broad access to other portions of the\ninternal network in order to get the best coverage from the\ntest.
