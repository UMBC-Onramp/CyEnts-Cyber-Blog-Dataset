Some of the useful tools in Windows to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities such as PageHeap do not help in detecting uninitialized memory.
On the contrary, PageHeap fills the memory allocations with patterns, which essentially makes them initialized.
There are few third-party tools, including Dr.Memory, that use binary instrumentation to detect memory safety issues such as heap overflows, uninitialized memory usages, use-after-frees, and others.
Detecting Uninitialized Memory in Image Decoding Detecting uninitialized memory in Windows usually requires binary instrumentation, especially when we do not have access to source code.
