There are several approaches which could be used to attempt to disable the hardware watchdog.
In this scenario, we decided to take advantage of the fact that the code which dealt with the hardware watchdog was in a shared library and exported.
This allowed for the creation of a new program using the existing watchdog-kicking code.
By creating a second program that will kick the hardware watchdog, we could debug the Delta application without the system resetting.
