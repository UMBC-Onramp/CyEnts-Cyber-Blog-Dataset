Immediate values in ARM are limited to 12 bits; eight of these bits are for the value itself and the other 4 are used for bit shifting.
This means that an immediate value can only be one byte long (two hex digits) but that byte can be zero padded in any fashion you like.
Therefore, loading a full memory address of 4 bytes using immediate values would take all 4 instructions, whether using MOV or ADD.
