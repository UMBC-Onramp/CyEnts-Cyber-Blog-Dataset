DoppelPaymer ransomware
The last villain of our roundup is DoppelPaymer, ransomware whose victims make up about 9% in the total statistics.
Its creators made a mark with other malware too, including the Dridex banking Trojan and the now-defunct BitPaymer (aka FriedEx) ransomware, which is considered an earlier version of DopplePaymer .
So the total number of victims of this group is in fact much higher.
Commercial organizations hit by DoppelPaymer include electronics and automobile manufacturers, as well as a large Latin American oil company.
