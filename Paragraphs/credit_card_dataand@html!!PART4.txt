The phishing kit uses techniques to evade phishing filters.
One technique is the use of AES encryption to encode the content presented at the client’s side, as seen in Figure 4.
The purpose of using this technique is code obfuscation, which helps to evade text-based detection.
By obfuscating the webpage, attackers try to deceive text-based classifiers and prevent them from inspecting webpage content.
This technique employs two files, a PHP and a JavaScript file that have functions to encrypt and decrypt input strings.
The PHP file is used to encrypt the webpages at the server side, as seen in Figure 5.
At the client side, the encrypted content is decoded using a defined function in the JavaScript file, as seen in Figure 6.
Finally, the webpage is rendered using the ‘document.write’ function.
