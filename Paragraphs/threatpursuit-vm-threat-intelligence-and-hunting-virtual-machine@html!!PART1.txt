Skilled adversaries can deceive detection and often employ new measures in their tradecraft.
Keeping a stringent focus on the lifecycle and evolution of adversaries allows analysts to devise new detection mechanisms and response processes.
Access to the appropriate tooling and resources is critical to discover these threats within a timely and accurate manner.
Therefore, we are actively compiling the most essential software packages into a Windows-based distribution: ThreatPursuit VM .
ThreatPursuit Virtual Machine (VM) is a fully customizable, open-sourced Windows-based distribution focused on threat intelligence analysis and hunting designed for intel and malware analysts as well as threat hunters to get up and running quickly.
