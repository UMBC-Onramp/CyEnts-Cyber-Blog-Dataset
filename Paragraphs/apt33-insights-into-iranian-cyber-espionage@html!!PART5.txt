The generalized targeting of organizations involved in energy and petrochemicals mirrors previously observed targeting by other suspected Iranian threat groups, indicating a common interest in the sectors across Iranian actors.
Figure 1 shows the global scope of APT33 targeting.
Figure 1: Scope of APT33 Targeting Spear
Phishing APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry.
These emails included recruitment themed lures and contained links to malicious HTML application (.hta) files.
The .hta files contained job descriptions and links to legitimate job postings on popular employment websites that would be relevant to the targeted individuals.
An example .hta
file excerpt is provided in Figure 2.
To the user, the file would appear as benign references to legitimate job postings; however, unbeknownst to the user, the .hta file also contained embedded code that automatically downloaded a custom APT33 backdoor.
Figure 2: Excerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta
file We assess APT33 used a built-in phishing module within
the publicly available ALFA
TEaM Shell (aka ALFASHELL) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in 2016.
Many of the phishing emails appeared legitimate – they referenced a specific job opportunity and salary, provided a link to the spoofed company’s employment website, and even included the spoofed company’s Equal Opportunity hiring statement.
However, in a few cases, APT33 operators left in the default values of the shell’s phishing module.
