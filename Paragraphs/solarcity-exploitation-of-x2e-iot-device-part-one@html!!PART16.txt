Common serial interfaces are Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) or Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), while a common parallel interface for NAND is Open NAND Flash Interface (ONFI2.0, ONFI3.0).
The X2e is a parallel flash.
IC Form Factor : Another visually identifiable trait—form factor (or “package”)—refers to how the chip is attached to the PCB.
There is a long list of options here , but common surface-mount flash packages include small outline package (SOP), thin outline small package (TOSP), or a variant of ball grid array (*BGA).
The key distinction here is SOP and TOSP expose the pins, while BGA conceals the pins under the package.
The X2e is BGA63, also referred to as a 63-pin BGA package.
Managed verses Unmanaged Flash : This one is more applicable to NAND, for reasons alluded to in the NAND verses NOR section.
As stated, NAND needs help to manage the integrity of the data.
With unmanaged NAND, the IC reserves sections of the flash (often called “spare” area) for someone else to manage the data.
