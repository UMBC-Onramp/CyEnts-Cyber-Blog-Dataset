Some of the most common activities attackers perform on these systems include password-dumping, reconnaissance and data theft.
Seeing that the attacker had staged file archives and utilities in the \"$Recycle.
Bin\" folder, John also created an IOC to find artifacts present there.
This IOC was designed to identify files in the root of the \"$Recycle.
Bin\" directory; or to identify if a user (notably, the attacker) tried to access the \"$Recycle.
Bin\" folder by manually typing it in the address bar of Explorer by checking TypedPaths in the Registry.
This is an example of encapsulating an attacker's TTPs in an OpenIOC form.
