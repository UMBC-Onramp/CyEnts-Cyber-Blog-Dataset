Within this mode, strong authentication takes place before the remote desktop connection is established, using the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) either through TLS or Kerberos.
NLA can also help to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, where credentials are intercepted.
However, be aware that NLA over NTLM does not provide strong authentication and should be disabled in favor of NLA over TLS (with valid certificates).
Microsoft TechNet describes configuration and usage of NLA in Windows Server 2008 R2 here .
Interestingly, BlueKeep, mentioned above, is partially mitigated by having NLA enabled.
