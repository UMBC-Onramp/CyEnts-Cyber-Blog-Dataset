We examined more closely the packets that are sent before the data packets.
We learned that even though the packets are sent with UDP, some sort of handshake is performed between the two devices.
The next diagram describes this handshake.
In this fanciful dialog, CMS is the central monitoring system; PM is the patient monitor.
To understand what is happening during the handshake, we can relate each phase of this handshake to that of a TCP three-way handshake.
