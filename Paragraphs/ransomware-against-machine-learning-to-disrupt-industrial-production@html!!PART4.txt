In post-compromise ransomware incidents, a threat actor may still often rely on broadly distributed malware to obtain their initial access to a victim environment, but once on a network they will focus on gaining privileged access so they can explore the target networks and identify critical systems before deploying the ransomware.
This approach also makes it possible for the attacker to disable security processes that would normally be enough to detect known ransomware indicators or behaviors.
Actors cast wider nets that may impact critical systems, which Â expand the scale and effectiveness of their end-stage operations by inflicting maximum pain on the victim.
