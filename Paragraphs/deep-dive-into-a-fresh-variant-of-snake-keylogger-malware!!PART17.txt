Snake Keylogger collects basic information regarding the victim’s Windows system, like User name, PC name, System Date and Time, Public IP address, and Country, which are put in the header of the collected credentials.
Figure 5.1 shows crafting the email with stolen credentials to be sent to the attacker.
The bottom is the email’s Subject and Body.
The stolen credentials are put in two attachments, “Passwords.txt” and “User.txt”.
Figure 5.2 is a screenshot of “Password.txt” attached to the email sent to the attacker with basic information and credentials stolen from my testing Windows system.
