Our unparalleled understanding of groups like UNC2198 is translated into Mandiant Advantage .
Accessing our holdings in Mandiant Advantage aids defenders in recognizing TTPs used by threat actors, assessing organizational risk, and taking action.
Initial investments made into rapidly assessing a groupâ€™s modus operandi pays dividends when they inevitably evolve and swap out components of their toolset.
Whether it be MAZE or EGREGOR, something icy or hot, Advanced Practices will continue to pursue these unchill threat actors.
