FireEye discovered a supply chain attack trojanizing SolarWinds Orion business software updates in order to distribute malware we call SUNBURST.

The campaign is widespread, affecting public and private organizations around the world.
FireEye is releasing signatures to detect this threat actor and supply chain attack in the wild.
