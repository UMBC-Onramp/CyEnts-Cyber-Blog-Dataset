# Compiled at: 2017-08-03 10:46:51 TsLow.pyc (Figure 1) contains several pieces of code for error handling, but these also present some cues to the protocol structure.
Figure 1: TsLow.pyc function print_last_error()
In the TsLow.pyc’s function for print_last_error we see error handling for “TCM Error”.
