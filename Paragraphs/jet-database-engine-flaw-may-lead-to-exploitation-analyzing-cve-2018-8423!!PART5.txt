From this information, we can guess the type of data that is stored there.
It appears to be an array in which each variable is 4 bytes long and starts at the location edx+574h.
While tracking the program, we determined the value 0x00002300 comes from the proof-of-concept file group1.
We know that the program attempts to write out of bounds and we know where the attempt occurs.
Now we need to determine why the program attempts to write at that location.
