The FireEye Front Line Applied Research & Expertise (FLARE)
Team attempts to always stay on top of the most current and emerging threats.
As a member of the FLARE Reverse Engineer team, I recently received a request to analyze a fairly new credential stealer identified as MassLogger.
Despite the lack of novel functionalities and features, this sample employs a sophisticated technique that replaces the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) at run time to hinder static analysis.
At the time of this writing, there is only one publication discussing the MassLogger obfuscation technique in some detail.
Therefore, I decided to share my research and tools to help analyze MassLogger and other malware using a similar technique .
