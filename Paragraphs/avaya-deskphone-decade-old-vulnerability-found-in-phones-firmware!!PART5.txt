In most cases, two of the main targets are recovering the files on the system so as to study how the device functions, and then finding a way to interact directly with the system in a privileged fashion (beyond what a normal user should be able to do).
The two can be intertwined, for instance getting a privileged access to the system can enable a researcher to recover the files stored on it, while recovering the files first can show how to enable a privileged access.
In this case, recovering the files was straightforward, but gaining a privileged access required a little more patience.
Recovering the Files From the Phone When we say recovering the files from the phone, we mean looking for the operating system and the various pieces of software running on it.
User files, e.g. contacts, settings and call logs, are usually not of interest to a security researcher and will not be covered here.
