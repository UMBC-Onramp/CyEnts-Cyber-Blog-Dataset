For this we will use lcamtufâ€™s HTML, which loads the PoC image multiple times and compares the pixels with reference pixels.
Figure 3: CVE-2020-0853 As we can see from the resulting images (Figure 3), the output varies drastically in each decoding and we can assume this PoC leaks a lot of uninitialized memory.
To identify the root cause of these vulnerabilities, I used Time Travel Debugging (TTD) extensively.
Tracing back the execution and keeping track of the memory address is a tedious task, but TTD makes it only slightly less painful by keeping the addresses and values constant and providing unlimited forward and backward executions.
