This technique is widely known by attackers and can be done easily with cheap hardware.
The attack consists of intercepting the signal from a wireless key to either block the signal to lock the car or replay the signal to gain access.
One variant of the attack uses a jammer to block the signal.
The jammer interferes with the electromagnetic waves used to communicate with the vehicle, blocking the signal and preventing the car from locking, leaving access free to the attacker.
Some jammers have a range of more than 500 meters.
Key fob jammer.
Another attack intercepts the signal sent by the key and replays it to open the door.
Auto manufacturers protect against this kind of attack by implementing security algorithms that avoid simple replays with same signal.
Each signal sent from the key to the car is unique, thus avoiding a replay.
However, one proof of concept for this attack blocks the signal to the car and stores it.
