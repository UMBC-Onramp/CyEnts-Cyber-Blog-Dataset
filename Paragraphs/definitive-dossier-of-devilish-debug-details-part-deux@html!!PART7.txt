Feature Representations
How do we represent these differences to a model?
The easiest and most obvious option is to calculate some statistics on each path.
Features such as folder depth, path length, entropy, and counting things such as numbers, letters, and special characters in the PDB filename are easy to compute.
However, upon evaluation against our dataset, these features did not help to separate the classes very well.
The following are some graphics detailing the distributions of these features between our classes of malicious and benign samples: While there is potentially some separation between benign and malicious distributions, these features alone would likely not lead to an effective classifier (we tried).
Additionally, we couldnâ€™t easily translate these differences into explicit detection rules.
There was more information in the paths that we needed to extract, so we began to look at how to encode the directory names themselves.
