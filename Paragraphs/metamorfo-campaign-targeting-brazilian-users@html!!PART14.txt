Contents of Dropped VBS File Banking Trojan Analysis Like the Trojan from the first campaign, this sample is executed through search-order hijacking.
In this case, the binary abused is a legitimate Windows tool, Certmgr.exe, that loads Cryptui.dll.
Since this tool depends on a legitimate DLL named cryptui.dll, the search order path will find the malicious Trojan with the same name in the same directory and load it into its process space.
The malicious DLL exports 21 functions.
Only DllEntryPoint contains real code that is necessary to start the execution of the malicious code.
The other functions return hardcoded values that serve no real purpose.
On execution, the Trojan creates a mutex called \"correria24\" to allow only one instance of it to run at a time.
