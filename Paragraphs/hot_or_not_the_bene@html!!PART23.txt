Threat model for JSPatch used by an app targeted by MITM Field Survey JSPatch originated from China.
Since its release in 2015, it has garnered success within the Chinese region.
According to JSPatch, many popular and high profile Chinese apps have adopted this technology.
FireEye app scanning found a total 1,220 apps in the App Store that utilize JSPatch.
We also found that developers outside of China have adopted this framework.
On one hand, this indicates that JSPatch is a useful and desirable technology in the iOS development world.
On the other hand, it signals that users are at greater risk of being attacked – particularly if precautions are not taken to ensure the security of all parties involved.
Despite the risks posed by JSPatch, FireEye has not identified any of the aforementioned applications as being malicious.
Food For Thought Many applaud Apple’s App Store for helping to keep iOS malware at bay.
While it is undeniably true that the App Store plays a critical role in winning this acclaim, it is at the cost of app developers’ time and resources.
