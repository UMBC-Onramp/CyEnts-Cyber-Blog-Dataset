Once launched the first thing the decryptor does is to search the HKEY_CURRENT_USER Hive for a value pair named “svchos” in the path “SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” and delete the specific entry.
This removes the persistence of the malware.
Afterwards it will reboot the system and remove any remaining Ryuk malware still receding on the system.
Deleting the “svchos” value from the registry.
Once rebooted the user needs to run the tool again and the decryptor will provide two options to decrypt.
