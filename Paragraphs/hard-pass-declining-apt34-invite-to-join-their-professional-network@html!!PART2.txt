Three key attributes caught our eye with this particular campaign: Masquerading as a member of Cambridge University to gain victims’ trust to open malicious documents, The usage of LinkedIn to deliver malicious documents, The addition of three new malware families to APT34’s arsenal.
FireEye’s platform successfully thwarted this attempted intrusion, stopping a new malware variant dead in its tracks.
Additionally, with the assistance of our FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE), Intelligence, and Advanced Practices teams, we identified three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET, malware exclusively observed in use by APT34.
