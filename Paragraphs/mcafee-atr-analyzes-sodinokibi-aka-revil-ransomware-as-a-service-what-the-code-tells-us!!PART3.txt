Reversing the Code In this first episode, we will dig into the code and explain the inner workings of the ransomware once it has executed on the victimâ€™s machine.
Overall the code is very well written and designed to execute quickly to encrypt the defined files in the configuration of the ransomware.
The embedded configuration file has some interesting options which we will highlight further in this article.
Based on the code comparison analysis we conducted between GandCrab and Sodinokibi we consider it a likely hypothesis that the people behind the Sodinokibi ransomware may have some type of relationship with the GandCrab crew.
