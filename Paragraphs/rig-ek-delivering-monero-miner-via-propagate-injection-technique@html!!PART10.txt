The PROPagate method is similar to the SetWindowLong injection technique.
In this method, the malware uses the SetPropA function to modify the callback for UxSubclassInfo and cause the remote process to execute the malicious code.
This code injection technique only works for a process with lesser or equal integrity level.
The malware first checks whether the integrity of the current running process is medium integrity level (2000, SECURITY_MANDATORY_MEDIUM_RID).
