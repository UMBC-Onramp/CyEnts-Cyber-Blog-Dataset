For example, the following is a brief portion of the encoded string taken from the code.
This encoded string strHTML goes through a complex sequence of around 23 decrypting/decoding functions that include number system conversions, pseudo-random pattern modifiers followed by XOR decoding using a fixed key or password “zycode” for the actual HTML phishing content to be finally created (refer to Figure 15 and Figure 16 in Appendix 1 for complete code).
Phishing detection systems that rely solely on the HTML in the response section will completely fail to detect the code generated using this technique.
Once loaded into the web browser, this obfuscated JavaScript creates an iCloud phishing page.
