When Good.xml is executed, it first creates a file named \"Startups32.vbs\" in the system startup folder.
The .vbs script contains code to run Good.xml file after each system startup to maintain persistence.
(See Mitre ATT&CK technique â€“ Persistence .) .NET
RAT Loader
After achieving persistence, Good.xml retrieves the .NET
Rat loader from the byte array and loads it into the current application.
The .NET
RAT loader is contained in the byte array sBytes in the XML, which is loaded using the method Thread.
GetDomain.
Load(sBytes).
The method Thread.
GetDomain() returns the domain of the current running thread, while Load() dynamically loads the byte array assembly into the current application domain during runtime.
