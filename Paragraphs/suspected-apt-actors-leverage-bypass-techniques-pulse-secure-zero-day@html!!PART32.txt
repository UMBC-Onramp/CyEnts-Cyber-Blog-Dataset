SLOWPULSE Variant 2 ACE Two Factor Auth Credential Logging We also identified a variant of SLOWPULSE (SHA256: 1ab50b77dd9515f6cd9ed07d1d3176ba4627a292dc4a21b16ac9d211353818bd ) which logs credentials used during ACE-2FA protocol authentication.
The backdoor is implemented in the routine DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword .
As part of the login procedure the username and password are retrieved then written into a map entry structure.
The backdoor inserts an unconditional jump into the logon logic that takes this map entry structure, reads the username and password fields, then writes them to the file /home/perl/PAUS.pm in a+ (append) mode, using the format string %s:%s\\n .
The backdoor then unconditionally jumps back into the normal control flow to continue the logon process as normal.
SLOWPULSE Variant 3 ACE Two Factor Auth Bypass We Identified another variant of SLOWPULSE (SHA256: b1c2368773259fbfef425e0bb716be958faa7e74b3282138059f511011d3afd9 ) which is similar to SLOWPULSE VARIANT 2 the malicious logic lives within DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword , however this variant bypasses the logon procedure rather than login credentials.
Typical execution of this routine calls DsSecID_checkLogin to validate the username and password which sets the EAX register to 1.
The routine DSAuth::AceAuthServer::handleACEAuthResult then checks EAX to determine if auth was successful or not.
The malicious logic hijacks execution immediately after the username and password fields are written to their map entries, then checks if the password matches the backdoor password.
