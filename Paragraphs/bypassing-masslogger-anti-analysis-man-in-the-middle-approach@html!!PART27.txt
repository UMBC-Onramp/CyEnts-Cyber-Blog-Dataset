Although this technique is not new, I haven’t seen many .NET
malwares making use of it, let alone trying to implement their own adaptation instead of using widely available protectors like ConfuserEx.
Hopefully, with this blog post and JITM , analysts will now have the tools and knowledge to defeat MassLogger or any future variants that use a similar technique.
If this is the type of work that excites you; and, if you thrive to push the state of the art when it comes to malware analysis and reverse engineering, the Front Line Applied Research and Expertise (FLARE) team may be a good place for you.
The FLARE team faces fun and exciting challenges on a daily basis; and we are constantly looking for more team members to tackle these challenges head on.
Check out FireEye’s career page to see if any of our opportunities would be a good fit for you.
