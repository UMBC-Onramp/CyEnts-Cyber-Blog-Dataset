Now changes that users make in their IDB file, e.g. by patching instructions to manually enhance analysis, are immediately available during emulation.
Moreover, the tool more robustly supports different architectures including x86, AMD64, and ARM.
Stackstrings:
An Example The disassembly listing in Figure 1 shows an example string obfuscation from the sample I analyzed.
The malware creates a string at run-time by moving each character into adjacent stack addresses (gray highlights).
Finally, the sample passes the stringâ€™s starting offset as an argument to the InternetOpen API call (blue highlight).
Manually following these memory moves and restoring strings by hand is a very cumbersome process.
Especially if malware complicates value assignments using additional instructions like illustrated below.
Figure 1: Disassembly listing showing stackstring creation and usage Because malware often uses stack memory to create such strings, Jay Smith coined the term stackstrings for this anti-analysis technique.
