The malware communicates with the following hard-coded hosts using HTTP over TCP port 80.
The malware also uses a domain name generation algorithm as described below.
188.138.88.184 31.41.47.37 5.34.183.136 91.121.97.170 Beacon Packet The malware beacon builds a HTTP POST request to /main.php as shown in Figure 9.
The POST data is encoded using a custom algorithm.

Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)
This sample contains a domain name generation algorithm that is based on the current month, day and year.
There are eight possible domains per day and the domains change on the first of the month and on even numbered days.
Figure 10 contains Python code to generate the eight possible domain names for the current date.
