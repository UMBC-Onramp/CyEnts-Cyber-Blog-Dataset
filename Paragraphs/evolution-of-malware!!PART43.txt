In this model, affiliates would do all the dirty work (reconnaissance, lateral movement, delivering the ransomware, collecting the money, etc.) while the authors stayed in the background and took a cut (estimates are that they collected between 25% and 40%) of the actual ransom This proved to be lucrative for both parties, as the authors didn’t have to take the risk of finding and infecting targets, and affiliates didn’t have to spend time trying to develop the ransomware themselves.
GandCrab also appears to have followed the Agile development process, with minor and major releases deployed whenever the authors would see fit.
