Groups and families linked by code reuse.
The malware attributed to the group Lazarus has code connections that link many of the malware families spotted over the years.
Lazarus is a collective name for many DPRK cyber operations, and we clearly see links between malware families used in different campaigns.
The malware (NavRAT, gambling, and Gold Dragon) possibly created by Group 123 are connected to each other but are separate from those used by Lazarus.
Although these are different units focusing on different areas, there seems to be a parallel structure in which they collaborate during certain campaigns.
MITRE ATT&CK From our research of these malware samples, we can identify the following techniques used by the malware families: When we zoom in on the Discovery category in the MITRE model, for example, we notice that the techniques are typical for first-stage dropper malware.
The adversary drops these samples on victims’ machines and collects information on where they landed in the victims’ networks and which user/access rights they gained.
