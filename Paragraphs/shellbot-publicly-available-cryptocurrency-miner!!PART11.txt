OpSec by Segmentation From the way bots are filtered, moved to other botnets and run new malware versions, it can be inferred that there is some sort of tiered segmentation.
Conversations found on the server are proof that trading bots among operators are rather common, which explains how botnets can double in size quickly.
The benefit of tiered segmentation is that it makes it very hard to find IRC server information on Tier 2 servers and higher, since these are only deployed by Tier 1 operators.
