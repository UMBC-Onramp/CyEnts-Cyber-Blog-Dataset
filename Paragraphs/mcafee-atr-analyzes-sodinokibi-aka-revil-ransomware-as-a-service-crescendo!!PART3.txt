We noticed some of our honeypot RDP servers were attacked by Persian-speaking actors that were actively harvesting credentials.
Our analysis of these attacks led us to various Persian underground channels offering the same tools we observed appearing in Sodinokibi intrusions.
Some of these tools are closed source and custom made, originating from within the channels in our analysis.
