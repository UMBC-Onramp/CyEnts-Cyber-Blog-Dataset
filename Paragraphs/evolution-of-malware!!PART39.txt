Part of the framework included malware known as DoublePulsar, a backdoor attack that contained the infamous “EternalBlue” exploit.
EternalBlue was a zero-day exploit that the NSA kept in their arsenal that targeted Microsoft’s SMB (Server Message Block) protocol (CVE-2017-0444).
It was later used to spread the infamous WannaCry , Petya/NotPetya ransomware, with disastrous consequences.
These ransomware variants were so disruptive that they caused the shutdown of manufacturing facilities worldwide.
