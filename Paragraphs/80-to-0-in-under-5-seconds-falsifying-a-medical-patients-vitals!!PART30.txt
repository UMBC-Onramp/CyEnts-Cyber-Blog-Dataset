Vendors can encrypt network traffic between the devices and add authentication.
These two steps would drastically increase the difficulty of this type of attack.
Vendors also typically recommend that medical equipment is run on a completely isolated network with very strict network-access controls.
If medical facilities follow these recommendations, attackers would require physical access to the network, greatly helping to reduce the attack surface.
One goal of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team is to identify and illuminate a broad spectrum of threats in todayâ€™s complex and constantly evolving landscape.
Through responsible disclosure we aim to assist and encourage the industry toward a more comprehensive security posture.
As part of our policy, we reported this research to the vendor whose products we tested and will continue to work with other vendors to help secure their products.
