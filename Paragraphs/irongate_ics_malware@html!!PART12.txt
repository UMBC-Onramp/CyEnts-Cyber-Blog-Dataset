Second, Siemens ProductCERT informed us that scada.exe is not a default file name associated with Siemens industrial control software.
When scada.exe executes, it scans drives attached to the system for filenames ending in Step7ProSim.dll .
According to the Siemens ProductCERT, Step7ProSim.dll is not part of the Siemens PLCSIM software.
We were unable to determine whether this DLL was created specifically by the malware author, or if it was from another source, such as example code or a particular custom ICS implementation.
We surmise this DLL simulates generation of IO values, which would normally be provided by an S7-based controller, since the functions it includes appear derived from the Siemens PLCSIM environment.
