Establish Foothold & Maintain Presence
The use of legitimate credentials and broad distribution of BEACON across victim environments appear to be consistent approaches used by actors to establish their foothold in victim networks and to maintain presence as they look to meet their ultimate objective of deploying MAZE ransomware.
Despite these commonplace behaviors, we have observed an actor create their own domain account to enable latter-stage operations.
Across multiple incidents, threat actors deploying MAZE established a foothold in victim environments by installing BEACON payloads on many servers and workstations.
