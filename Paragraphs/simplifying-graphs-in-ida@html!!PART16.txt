Repeat for the remaining command handler grouped nodes.
Config You can tweak some of the configuration by entering data in a file named %IDAUSR%/SimplifyGraph.cfg, where %IDAUSR% is typically %APPDATA%/Hex-Rays/IDA Pro/ unless explicitly set to something else.
All of the config applies to the isolated subgraph component.
Options: * SUBGRAPH_HIGHLIGHT_COLOR:
Default 0xb3ffb3:
The color to apply to nodes when you double click/press enter in the chooser to show nodes that make up the currently selected isolated subgraph.
Not everyone agrees that my IDA color scheme is best, so you can set your own highlight color here.
* MINIMUM_SUBGRAPH_NODE_COUNT:
Default 3:
The minimum number of nodes for a valid isolated subgraph.
If a discovered subgraph has fewer nodes than this number it is not included in the shown list.
This prevents trivial two-node subgraphs from being shown.
* MAXIMUM_SUBGRAPH_NODE_PERCENTAGE: Default 95:
The maximum percent of group nodes (100.0 *(subgroup_node_count / total_function_node_count)) allowed.
This filters out isolated subgraphs that make up (nearly) the entire function, which are typically not interesting.
