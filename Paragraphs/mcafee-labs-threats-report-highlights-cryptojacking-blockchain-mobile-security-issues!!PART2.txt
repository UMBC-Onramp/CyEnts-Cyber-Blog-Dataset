One of the most significant shifts we see is that cryptojacking is still on the rise, while traditional ransomware attacks—aka “shoot and pray they pay”—are decreasing.
Ransomware attacks are becoming more targeted as actors conduct their research to pick likely victims, breach their networks, and launch the malware followed by a high-pressure demand to pay the ransom.
Although the total number of ransomware samples has fallen for two quarters, one family continues to spawn new variants.
The Scarab ransomware family, which entered the threat landscape in June 2017, developed a dozen new variants in Q2.
These variants combined make up more than 50% of the total number of Scarab samples to date.
What spiked the movement, starting in fall 2017, toward cryptojacking?
The first reason is the value of cryptocurrency.
If attacker can steal Bitcoins, for example, from a victim’s system, that’s enough.
