The actors used the Nltest command to list domain controllers.
Lateral Movement Lateral movement was most commonly accomplished using valid credentials in combination with Cobalt Strike BEACON, RDP and SMB, or using the same backdoors used to establish a foothold in victim networks.
The actors have regularly leveraged Cobalt Strike BEACON and Metasploit Meterpreter to move laterally within victim environments.
The actors commonly moved laterally within victim environments using compromised accounts—both those belonging to regular users and accounts with administrative privileges.
 In addition to the use of common post-exploitation frameworks, lateral movement has also been achieved using WMIC commands and the Windows RDP and SMB protocols.
The actors used the Windows net use command to connect to Windows admin shares to move laterally.
Complete Mission Mandiant is directly aware of incidents involving KEGTAP that included the post-compromise deployment of RYUK ransomware.
 We have also observed instances where ANCHOR infections, another backdoor associated with the same actors, preceded CONTI or MAZE deployment.
In at least one case, an executable was observed that was designed to exfiltrate files via SFTP to an attacker-controlled server.
The actors have used Cobalt Strike BEACON to exfiltrate data created through network reconnaissance activities as well as user files.
The actors were observed deleting their tools from victim hosts in an attempt to remove indicators of compromise.
The actors have used their access to the victim network to deploy ransomware payloads.
 There is evidence to suggest that RYUK ransomware was likely deployed via PsExec, but other scripts or artifacts related to the distribution process were not available for forensic analysis.
