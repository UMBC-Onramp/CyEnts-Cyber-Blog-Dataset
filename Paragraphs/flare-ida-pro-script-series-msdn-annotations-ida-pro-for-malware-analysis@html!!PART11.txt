After the script finishes execution the final XML database file should be located in the MSDN_data directory.
You can now run our plug-in to annotate your disassembly in IDA.
Running the MSDN annotations plug-in In IDA, use File - Script file...
(ALT + F7) to open the script named annotate_IDB_MSDN.py.
This will display the dialog box shown in Figure 7 that allows you to configure the modifications the plug-in performs.
By default, the plug-in annotates functions, arguments and rename constants.
If you change the settings and execute the plug-in by clicking OK, your settings get stored in a configuration file in the plug-in’s directory.
This allows you to quickly run the plug-in on other samples using your preferred settings.
If you do not choose to annotate functions and/or arguments, you will not be able to see the respective descriptions by hovering over the element.
