LockBit sample digitally signed Tales from the Underground When we researched the underground community for LockBit we came across a posting on several popular underground forums.
 A threat actor named Lockbi or LockBit is offering LockBit as a “bespoke” ransomware as a service for limited partners/affiliates.
We suspect LockBit ransomware to be more “bespoke”, not only from its own announcements, but subsequently we have not seen any affiliate identifiers present in the ransomware, which is normally a clear sign of an actor trying to upscale operations and service a larger number of affiliates.
The advertisement provides a general description that matches the LockBit behavior we have seen in the wild and from our analysis.
As many other cyber-criminal services, LockBit does not allow the use of the software in any of the CIS countries.
This is commonly done to avoid prosecution if the threat actor resides in one of those nations.
What we also noticed was a mention around multi-threading.
