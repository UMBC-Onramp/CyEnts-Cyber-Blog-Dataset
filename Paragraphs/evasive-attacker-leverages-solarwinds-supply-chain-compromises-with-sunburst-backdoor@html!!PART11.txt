This will uncover any single system authenticating to multiple systems with multiple accounts, a relatively uncommon occurrence during normal business operations.
Temporary File Replacement and Temporary Task Modification
The attacker used a temporary file replacement technique to remotely execute utilities: they replaced a legitimate utility with theirs, executed their payload, and then restored the legitimate original file.
They similarly manipulated scheduled tasks by updating an existing legitimate task to execute their tools and then returning the scheduled task to its original configuration.
They routinely removed their tools, including removing backdoors once legitimate remote access was achieved.
Detection Opportunity Defenders can examine logs for SMB sessions that show access to legitimate directories and follow a delete-create-execute-delete-create pattern in a short amount of time.
Additionally, defenders can monitor existing scheduled tasks for temporary updates, using frequency analysis to identify anomalous modification of tasks.
Tasks can also be monitored to watch for legitimate Windows tasks executing new or unknown binaries.
This campaignâ€™s post compromise activity was conducted with a high regard for operational security, in many cases leveraging dedicated infrastructure per intrusion.
