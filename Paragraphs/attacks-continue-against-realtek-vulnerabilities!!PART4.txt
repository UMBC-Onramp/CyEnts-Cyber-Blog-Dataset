This script is nearly identical to the one featured in last week’s post.
The only change is that the parameter passed to the downloaded binary is “exploit.realtek.http” instead of “exploit.realtek”.
When the botnet agent starts up, it opens a listening port on port 44842, and then opens a TCP connection to babaroga[.]lib (188[.]166.196.89, resolved specifically by DNS server 185[.]121.177.177) on port 53 and registers the compromised computer with the botnet, including an identifier — in this case, “exploit.realtek.http” — to indicate which attack was successful.
