Taking the list of transactions as a starting point in our graph-analysis, we colored the lines red and started from there to investigate the wallets involved and interesting transactions: Although it might look like spaghetti, once you dive in, very interesting patterns can be discovered.
We see victims paying to their assigned wallets; from there it takes an average of two to three transactions before it goes to an ‘affiliate’ or ‘distribution’ wallet.
From that wallet we see the split happening as the moniker ‘UNKN’ mentioned in his forum post we started this article with.
The 60 or 70 percent stays with the affiliate and the remaining 40/30 percent is forwarded in multiple transactions towards the actors behind Sodinokibi.
Once we identified a couple of these transactions, we started to dig in both directions.
What is the affiliate doing with the money and where is the money going for the Sodinokibi actors?
We picked one promising affiliate wallet and started to dig deeper down and followed the transactions.
