Here we release a library we call flare-dbg .
This library provides several utility classes and functions to rapidly develop scripts to automate debugging tasks within Windbg.
Stay tuned for future blog posts that will describe additional uses for debugger scripts!
String Decoding Malware authors like to hide the intent of their software by obfuscating their strings.
Quickly deobfuscating strings allows you to quickly figure out what the malware is doing.
As stated in Practical Malware Analysis, there are generally two approaches to deobfuscating strings: self-decoding and manual programming.
The self-decoding approach allows the malware to decode its own strings.
Manual programming requires the reverse engineer to reprogram the decoding function logic.
A subset of the self-decoding approach is emulation, where each assembly instruction execution is emulated.
Unfortunately, library call emulation is required, and emulating every library call is difficult and may cause inaccurate results.
In contrast, a debugger is attached to the actual running process, so all the library functions can be run without issue.
