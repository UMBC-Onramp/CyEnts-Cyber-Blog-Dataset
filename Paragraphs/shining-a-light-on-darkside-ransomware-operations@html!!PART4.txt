Reporting on DARKSIDE has been available in advance of this blog post to users of Mandiant Advantage Free , a no-cost version of our threat intelligence platform.
Targeting Mandiant has identified multiple DARKSIDE victims through our incident response engagements and from reports on the DARKSIDE blog.
Most of the victim organizations were based in the United States and span across multiple sectors, including financial services, legal, manufacturing, professional services, retail, and technology.
The number of publicly named victims on the DARKSIDE blog has increased overall since August 2020, with the exception of a significant dip in the number of victims named during January 2021 (Figure 1).
It is plausible that the decline in January was due to threat actors using DARKSIDE taking a break during the holiday season.
The overall growth in the number of victims demonstrates the increasing use of the DARKSIDE ransomware by multiple affiliates.
