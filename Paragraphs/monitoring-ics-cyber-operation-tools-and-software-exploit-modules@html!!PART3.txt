For this blog post, we separated exploit modules that are developed to run on top of frameworks such as Metasploit , Core Impact , or Immunity Canvas from other cyber operation tools due to their exceedingly high number.
Cyber Operation Tools Reduce the Level of Specialized Knowledge Attackers Need to Target ICS As ICS are a distinct sub-domain to information and computer technology, successful intrusions and attacks against these systems often requires specialized knowledge, establishing a higher threshold for successful attacks.
Since intrusion and attack tools are often developed by someone who already has the expertise, these tools can help threat actors bypass the need for gaining some of this expertise themselves, or it can help them gain the requisite knowledge more quickly.
Alternatively, experienced actors may resort to using known tools and exploits to conceal their identity or maximize their budget.
Figure 1: ICS attacker knowledge curve The development and subsequent adoption of standardized cyber operation tools is a general indication of increasing adversarial capability.
Whether these tools were developed by researchers as proof-of-concept or utilized during past incidents, access to them lowers the barrier for a variety of actors to learn and develop future skills or custom attack frameworks.
