If it guesses correctly, the user gets a performance boost.
If not, the CPU discards the speculatively executed instructions and runs the other set.
In a Spectre-vulnerability attack, an attempt is made to read a data area to which the program does not have access.
In the first stage of the attack, multiple calls are made to open-access data areas, whereby the branch prediction system is “trained” to perform the forbidden read operation as well.
Using branch prediction, the CPU performs the operation in advance because it is used to the program asking to read data that it is actually allowed to read.
But a check reveals that the program is prohibited from accessing the data, so the speculatively executed computations are discarded.
