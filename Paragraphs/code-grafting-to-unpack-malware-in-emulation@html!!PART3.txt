EVILNEST Scenario
My sample (MD5 hash 37F7F1F691D42DCAD6AE740E6D9CAB63 which is available on VirusTotal ) was an EVILNEST variant that populates the stack with configuration data before calling an intermediate payload.
Figure 1 shows this unusual call site.
Figure 1: Call site for intermediate payload The code in Figure 1 executes in a remote thread within a hollowed-out iexplore.exe process; the malware uses anti-analysis tactics as well.
I had the intermediate payload stage and wanted to unpack next-stage payloads without managing a multi-process debugging scenario with anti-analysis.
