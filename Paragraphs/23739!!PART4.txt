In case of Log4J versions from 2.10 to 2.14.1, they advise setting the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups system property, or setting the LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS environment variable to true .
To protect earlier releases of Log4j (from 2.0-beta9 to 2.10.0), the library developers recommend removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath: zip
-q -d log4j-core – *.
Jar org / apache / logging / log4j / core / lookup
/ JndiLookup .class .
In addition, we recommend to install security solutions on your servers — in many cases this will allow you to detect the launch of malicious code and stop the attack’s development.
