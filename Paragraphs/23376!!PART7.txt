To avoid falling prey to cybercriminals, make sure your accounts and devices are secure.
Protect your accounts with strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and generally max out the platform’s security settings (see our guides for Steam , Battle.net , Origin , Twitch , and Discord users).
Download apps only from official sources to minimize the chances of picking up BloodyStealer or other malware.
Be wary of links in e-mails and messages from strangers.
Before entering your credentials on any website, make sure it’s genuine.
Use a reliable security solution.
For example, Kaspersky Security Cloud blocks BloodyStealer and doesn’t interfere with gameplay .
