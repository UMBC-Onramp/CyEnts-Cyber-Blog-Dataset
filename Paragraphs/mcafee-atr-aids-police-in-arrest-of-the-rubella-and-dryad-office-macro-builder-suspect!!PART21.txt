TailoredTaboo.com mentioned on Twitter Based on all the references, and the way the domain Tailoredtaboo.com was used, we believe that the domain plays a central administrative role for both Rubella and Dryad Macro Builder and can provide insight into the customers of both Macro Builders Conclusion Toolkits that build weaponized Office documents, like Dryad and Rubella, cater to the increasing cybercriminal demand of this type of infection vector.
With the arrest of the suspect comes an end to the era of Dryad and Rubella Macro Builder.
Based on his activity, the suspect looked like quite the cybercriminal entrepreneur, but given his young age this is also a worrisome thought.
If only he would have used his skills for good.
The lure of quick cash was apparently more enticing than building a solid long-term career.
We at McAfee never like to see young talented individuals heading down a dark path.
