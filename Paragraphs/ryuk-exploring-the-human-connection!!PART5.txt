In order to construct a hypothesis with the least falsifying evidence we welcome research published by our industry peers to dissimilate insights that challenge our hypotheses.
When we combined all the evidence with links on the diamond model, we discovered that one essential link wasnâ€™t made, the link between adversary and victim.
Seeking New Insights Between Adversary and Victim Despite published research, the direct link between adversary and victim remained relatively unexplored.
Unlike most cybercrime, ransomware and digital extortion frequently creates a strong social connection between adversary and victim.
The adversary has certain needs and views the victim as the means to fulfill those needs.
The connection between an adversary and victim often generates valuable insights, especially in cases where (extensive) negotiation take place.
Luckily, one of our NoMoreRansom partners, Coveware, is specialized in ransomware negotiations and has gained valuable insights help us link adversary and victim.
