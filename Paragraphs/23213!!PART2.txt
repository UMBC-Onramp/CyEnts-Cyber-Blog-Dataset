Perhaps the most common surprise greedy gamers find in their popular games is adware.
Although not usually too harmful, adware can be very annoying.
With this uninvited guest on their computer or smartphone, users will constantly be closing banners, pop-up videos, and browser pages they didn’t open.
Cryptomining, a timeless threat In the hierarchy of bad stuff users might get with pirated games, cryptominers rank far higher than adware.

Cybercriminals take advantage of this, creating websites offering free keys, cracks, and unlocked versions of games; adding Trojans; and pushing them onto the first page of search results.
