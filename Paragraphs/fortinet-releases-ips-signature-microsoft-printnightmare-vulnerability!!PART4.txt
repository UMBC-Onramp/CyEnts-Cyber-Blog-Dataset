Microsoft has not yet provided any official statement to confirm whether this is a variation of the CVE-2021-1675 vulnerability or a new vulnerability altogether.
But according to Bleeping Computer , PrintNightmare is not the same as CVE-2021-1675 but a new Windows Print Spooler zero-day vulnerability.
This position is supported by reports from multiple threat researchers who have confirmed that they have achieved remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges on a fully patched system.
Security researchers will continue to investigate.
But regardless of the outcome of that investigation, neither a new nor an updated patch is currently available for this vulnerability.
And proof-of-concept code now in the wild is able to exploit Windows Print Spoolers even after systems have been fully patched.
