Since you and your iPhone are already far away from your backpack when you realize you lost it, UWB won’t help you.
Now anyone who has a relatively modern Apple device — iPhone 7 and newer — can get involved.
Using Bluetooth, they detect the AirTag nearby and transmit approximate or specific coordinates to your Apple account.
Now you can use Apple’s Find My service to see where your backpack has ended up — such as in the lost-and-found office or with a new owner.
What’s key is that all of this happens automatically; you don’t even need to install anything.
Everything the AirTag search system needs to work is already built into the iOS of hundreds of millions of users.
But considering that Bluetooth has a maximum distance range of just a few dozen meters, this works only in large cities, where there are a lot of people with iPhones.
