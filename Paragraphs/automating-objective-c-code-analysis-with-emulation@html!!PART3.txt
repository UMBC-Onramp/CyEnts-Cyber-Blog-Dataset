Pairing a disassembler with an emulator allows you to pause emulation at key instructions and inspect the contents of registers and memory.
This allows you to keep tabs on interesting data as it flows through a function.
This can have several applications.
As previously covered in other blogs in the FLARE script series, Automating Function Argument Extraction and Automating Obfuscated String Decoding , this technique can be used to track the arguments passed to a given function throughout an entire program.
Function argument tracking is one of the techniques employed by the Objective-C code analysis tool introduced later in this post.
