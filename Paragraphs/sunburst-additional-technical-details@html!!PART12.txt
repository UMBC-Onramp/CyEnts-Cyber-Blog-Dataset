A user ID is generated based on three values: MAC address of the first available, non-loopback network interface Domain name HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid value SUNBURST takes the MD5 hash of these combined values and encodes it using a custom XOR scheme.
We believe this value is used by UNC2452 to track unique victims.
SUNBURST uses four different forms of subdomains to signify the operating mode of the backdoor.
Each form contains slightly different information.
However, in two of the forms, investigators can recover the domain names of victim organizations.
We recommend reviewing DNS logs to confirm the presence of a victim’s domain in SUNBURST C2 coordinator traffic.
When SUNBURST is in its initial mode, it embeds the domain of the victim organization in its DGA-generated domain prefix.
Once the malware transitions to an “active” mode, the malware uses the other two forms of subdomains.
These do not include the AD domain, but instead include encodings of either the list of running and stopped services or a timestamp.
The open-source community has done a fantastic job reverse engineering many of the subdomain forms.
