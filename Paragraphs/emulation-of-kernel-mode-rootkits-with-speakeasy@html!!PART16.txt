Speakeasy tracks and tags all memory within the emulation space.
In the context of kernel mode emulation, this includes all kernel objects (e.g. Driver and Device objects, and the kernel modules themselves).
Immediately after we observe the malware inject its user mode implant, we see it begin to attempt to hook kernel components.
This was confirmed during static analysis to be used for network hiding.
The memory access section of the emulation report reveals that the malware modified the netio.sys driver, specifically code within the exported function named NsiEnumerateObjectsAllParametersEx .
This function is ultimately called when a user on the system runs the “netstat” command and it is likely that the malware is hooking this function in order to hide connected network ports on the infected system.
This inline hook was identified by the event captured in Figure 9.
Figure 9:
Inline function hook set by the malware to hide network connections In addition, the malware hooks the Tcpip driver object in order to accomplish additional network hiding.
Specifically, the malware hooks the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL handler for the Tcpip driver.
User mode code may send IOCTL codes to this function when querying for active connections.
