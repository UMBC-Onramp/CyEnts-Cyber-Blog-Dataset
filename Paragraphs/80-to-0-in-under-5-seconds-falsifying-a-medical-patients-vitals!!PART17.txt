If we can observe a certain ECG pattern, we can play it back to the central monitoring station without the patient monitor on the network.
Thus we can emulate the function of the patient monitor with any device.
The following video demonstrates this emulation using a Raspberry Pi.
We set our Scapy scripts to load after booting the Pi, which mimics the idle function of the patient monitor.
When the central monitor requests information about the patientâ€™s vitals, the Pi provides the station with an 80-beats-per-minute wave form.
