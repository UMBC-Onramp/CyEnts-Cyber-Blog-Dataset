Network C2 events The network indicators are summarized in the “network_events” and “traffic” sections of the generated report.
In Figure 10, we can see the IP address, port number and, in this case, HTTP headers associated with the connections made by the malware.
In this example, when we emulated the sample, we instructed Speakeasy to create a memory dump of the emulated address space.
A ZIP archive will get created of each memory allocation along with context around it.
This context includes base address, size and a tag that is assigned by the emulator in order to identify what the memory allocation corresponds to.
Figure 11 shows a snippet of the memory dump files created during emulation.
The file names contain the tag and base address associated with each memory allocation.
