This is either a bluff or a placeholder for future capabilities.
Browsing to the URL led to us a website, seen in figures 2 and 3, from which we derived the name for the ransomware.
As part of a rather unique encryption procedure, Diavol operates using user-mode Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs) without a symmetric encryption algorithm.
Usually, ransomware authors aim to complete the encryption operation in the shortest amount of time.
Asymmetric encryption algorithms are not the obvious choice as they significantly slower than symmetric algorithms.
