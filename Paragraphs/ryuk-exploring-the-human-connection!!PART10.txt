Ryuk Negotiating Profiles With few exceptions, the rest of the email replies during a Ryuk extortion negotiation are extremely short and blunt.
Typical replies and retorts are generally less than 10 written words and often just a single number if the ransom amount is the point of discussion.
This correspondence is unique to Ryuk.
One reply did contain quite a remarkable expression; “ à la guerre comme à la guerre,” to contextualize the methods and reasons for the cyber criminals’ attacks on western companies.
The French expression originates from the seventeenth century and literally translates to “in war as in war” and loosely translates to: “In Harsh times one has to do with what’s available”.
The striking thing about this expression is that is prominently featured in volume 30 of the collected works of the Soviet Revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin .
Lenin uses the expression to describe the struggle of his people during the war against western capitalism.
This concept of “The capitalistic West versus the Poor east” is actually something McAfee ATR sees quite often expressed by cyber criminals from some of the Post-Soviet republics.
