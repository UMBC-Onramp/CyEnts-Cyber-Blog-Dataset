Last week got us up close and personal with Darkleech and Blackhole with our external careers web site.
The fun didnâ€™t end there, this week we saw a tidal wave of Darkleech activity linked to a large-scale malvertising campaign identified by the following URL:
hXXp://delivery[.]globalcdnnode[.]com/7f01baa99716452bda5bba0572c58be9/afr-zone.php
Again Darkleech was up to its tricks, injecting URLs and sending victims to a landing page belonging to the Blackhole Exploit Kit, one of the most popular and effective exploit kits available today.
