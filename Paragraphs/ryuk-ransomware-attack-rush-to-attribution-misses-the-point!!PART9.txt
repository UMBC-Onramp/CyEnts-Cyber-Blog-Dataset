By following this method, we find the strongest hypothesis is not the one with the most verifying evidence, but the one with the least falsifying evidence.
Examining competing hypotheses is a scientific approach to investigating cyber incidents.
It may not help with the race to attribution, but it ensures the output is based on available evidence.
The most likely hypothesis in the Ryuk case is that of a cybercrime operation developed from a tool kit offered by a Russian-speaking actor.
From the evidence, we see sample similarities over the past several months that indicate a tool kit is being used.
The actors have targeted several sectors and have asked a high ransom, 500 Bitcoin.
Who is responsible?
We do not know.
But we do know how the malware works, how the attackers operate, and how to detect the threat.
That analysis is essential because it allows us to serve our customers.
