Bankshot was first reported by the Department of Homeland Security on December 13, 2017, and has only recently resurfaced in newly compiled variants.
The sample we analyzed is 99% similar to the documented Bankshot variants from 2017.
Bankshot implants hosted on falcancoin.io.
The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document with the filename Agreement.docx.
The document appears to be an agreement template for Bitcoin distribution between an unknown individual in Paris and a to-be-determined cryptocurrency exchange.
The author of this document is test-pc.
It was created February 26 and was submitted from the Netherlands.
The document contains an embedded Flash script that exploits CVE-2018-4878 and downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.
We discovered two more documents, written in Korean, that exploit the same vulnerability as Agreement.docx.
These documents appear to be part of the same campaign and may have been used on different targets.
These documents also communicated with falcancoin.io to install Bankshot and also contain themes around cryptocurrency security.
