A day later, the threat actor positioned a custom Linux backdoor, which Mandiant named LEMONSTICK, on the same workstation.
LEMONSTICK capabilities include command execution, file transfer and execution, and the ability to establish tunnel connections.
(see Figure 2).

SSH Port Forwarding is a mechanism implemented in SSH protocol for transporting arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH connection (tunneling).
This feature can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications traversing firewalls or with malicious intent to access internal networks from the the internet.
The UNC1945 configurations we observed are similarly structured with respect to the host alias, specified options, and option order (see Figure 3).
