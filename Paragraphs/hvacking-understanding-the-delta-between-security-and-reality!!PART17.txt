So, how did the wrong destination address get passed to memcpy?
To answer this, we needed a better understanding of how the system processes incoming packets along with what code is responsible for setting up the buffers sent to memcpy.
We can use ps to evaluate the system as it is running to see that the main process spawns 19 threads: Table 1 The function wherein we found the “scNetMove” was called “scBIPRxTask” and was only referenced in one other location outside of the main binary; the initialization function for the application’s networking, shown in Figure 12.
