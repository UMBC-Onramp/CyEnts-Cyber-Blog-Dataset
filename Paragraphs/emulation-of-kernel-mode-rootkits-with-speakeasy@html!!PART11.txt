Next, the malware manually copies the in-memory DLL into the services.exe process address space.
These memory write events are captured and shown in Figure 6.

Memory write events captured while copying the user mode implant into services.exe A common technique that rootkits use to execute user mode code involves a Windows feature known as Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC).
APCs are functions that execute asynchronously within the context of a supplied thread.
Using APCs allows kernel mode applications to queue code to run within a threadâ€™s user mode context.
