Figure 3.3 is the entire code of function “ClassLibrary3.Class1.Run()”.
After successfully calling \"ClassLibrary3.Class1.Run()\" of the decoded PE, it downloads two files from the hyperlinks: 'hxxp[:]//149.56.200.165/rump/1.txt', which is for another .Net module to perform process-hollowing, and 'hxxps[:]//bitbucket[.]org/!api/2.0/snippets/hogya/nxq8od/c73df176f221868c33d4b3033ec04dc173d4ba4c/files/divine1-1', which is passed from PowerShell and is where it downloads the Agent Tesla payload from.
The Agent Tesla payload is fileless on the victim’s system.
It is only kept in the memory of the PowerShell process.
The downloaded .Net module has a function named “ClassLibrary1.Class1.Run()” that perform the process-hollowing.
