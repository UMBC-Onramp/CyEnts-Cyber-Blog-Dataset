net ->
This value can be false or true.
By default, it is usually true, meaning that the malware will send information about the victim if they have Internet access to the domain list in the field “dmn” in the config.
nbody ->
A big string encoded in base64 that is the template for the ransom note that will appear in each folder where the malware can create it.
nname ->
The string of the name of the malware for the ransom note file.
It is a template that will have a part that will be random in the execution.
exp ->
This field is very important in the config.
By default it will usually be ‘false’, but if it is ‘true’, or if the check of the hash of the config fails, it will use the exploit CVE-2018-8453.
The malware has this value as false by default because this exploit does not always work and can cause a Blue Screen of Death that avoids the malware’s goal to encrypt the files and request the ransom.
