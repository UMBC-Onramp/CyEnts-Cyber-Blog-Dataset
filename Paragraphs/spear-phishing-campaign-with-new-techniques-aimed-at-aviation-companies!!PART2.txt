Spear Phishing Campaign Overview
The infection cycle begins with phishing emails sent to aviation companies that contain malicious links disguised as pdf attachments.
The link in the email directs the user to VB Script hosting sites, from which the initial payload (.vbs) is delivered.
The .vbs script then drops the second stage payload, an xml file containing inline C# .NET assembly code that acts as a RAT loader.
The loader hollows and injects the final payload, AsyncRAT, into the victim process (RegSvcs.exe).
AsyncRAT, also known as RevengeRAT, connects to its C2 server, takes control of the compromised machine, and introduces additional payload.
I will now dive into each of these steps in a bit more detail.
Spear Phishing Email Spear phishing is a highly targeted attack resulting from extensive research on targeted users and their organizations conducted by threat actors.
