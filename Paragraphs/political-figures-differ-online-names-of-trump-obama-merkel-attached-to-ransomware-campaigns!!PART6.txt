Although it would be simple to claim an increase in politically motivated ransomware, or rather ransomware that leverages the profiles of political figures, there is no significant evidence to suggest they are from the same threat actor.
Equally, these campaigns might not even be ransomware, certainly in the case of the Obama campaign.
Does this examination suggest three separate campaigns?
There are some links and, no, they are not between Obama and Trump.
The Trump and Merkel ransomware are 46% identical in code.
We are left wondering whose campaign is the most successful.
We shall see.
