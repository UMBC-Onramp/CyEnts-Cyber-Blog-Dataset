As we had successfully extracted the firmware, we used IDA Pro to attempt to learn more about why this crash was occurring.
The developers did not strip the binaries during compiling time, which helped simplify the reversing process in IDA.
Figure 8 The disassembly told us that memcpy was attempting to write what was in R3 to the “address” stored in R0.
In this case, however, we had corrupted that address, causing the segmentation fault.
The contents of several other registers also provided additional information.
The value 0x81 in R3 was potentially the first byte of a BACnet packet from the BACnet Virtual Link Control (BVLC) layer, identifying the packet as BACnet.
By looking at R3 and the values at the address in R5 together, we confirmed with more certainty that this was in fact the BVLC layer.
