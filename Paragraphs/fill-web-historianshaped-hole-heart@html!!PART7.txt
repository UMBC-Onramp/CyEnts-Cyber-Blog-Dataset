Figure 3: Displaying your web history data for review in both Web Historian (behind) and Redline (front)
Although similar, Redline does have a few minor differences in how it visualizes your data: Redline does not break the data into pages; instead it will discretely page in large data sets (25k+ rows) automatically as you scroll down through the list.
To configure the table view, you will need to manipulate the column headers for ordering and resizing, and right-click on a column header to show and hide columns - as opposed to using the column configuration menu in Web Historian.
Searching and simple filtering is done in each individual table view and is not applied globally.
To access the find options, either press the magnifying glass in the bottom right corner, or press Ctrl-f while a table view is selected.
To export your data to a CSV (comma separated values) format file, click on export in the bottom right corner.
