This will log all reads, writes and executes to memory.
Since the emulator tags all allocated memory chunks, it is possible to glean much more context from this data.
If malware hooks a critical data structure or pivots execution to dynamically mapped memory this will be revealed and can be useful for debugging or attribution.
This feature comes at a great speed cost, however, and is not enabled by default.
The emulated environment presented to malware includes common data structures that shellcode uses to locate and execute exported Windows system functions.
