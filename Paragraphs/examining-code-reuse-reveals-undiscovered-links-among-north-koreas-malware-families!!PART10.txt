Operation Dark Hotel In 2014, Kaspersky reported a more than seven-year campaign against Asian hotels, in which the adversaries used an arsenal of tools to break into the computers of hotel visitors.
Zero days and control servers were used, along with the malware family Tapaoux, or DarkHotel, according to the report.
