Dynamic Analysis When we ran the application, it asked us to enter a login and password in order to run.
We also noticed a number-generated HWID (Hardware-ID) that was always the same when running the app.
The HWID number is a unique identifier specific to the machine it was running on and was used to register the app.
When trying to enter a random name we detected a remote connection to the website ‘hxxps://tailoredtaboo.com/auth/check.php’ to verify the license.
