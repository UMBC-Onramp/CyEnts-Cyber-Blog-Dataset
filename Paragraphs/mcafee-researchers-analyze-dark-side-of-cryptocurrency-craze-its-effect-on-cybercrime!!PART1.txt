By Charles McFarland and Shivangee Trivedi on Mar 11, 2018 In December 2017 Bitcoin values skyrocketed, peaking at the unprecedented amount of roughly US$19,000 per coin.
Unsurprisingly, the market for cryptocurrencies exploded in response.
Investors, companies, and even the public found a fresh interest in digital currencies.
However, the exciting change in Bitcoin value did not just influence your average wealth seeker.
It also influenced vast underground cybercriminal markets, malware developers, and cybercriminal behavior.
Blessing and Curse The surge of Bitcoin popularity and price per coin piqued the interest of cybercriminals, driving cryptocurrency hijacking in the last quarter of 2017.
However, the same popularity and price jump also created a headache for bad actors.
Ransomware techniques and the buying and selling of goods became problematic.
The volatility of the Bitcoin market makes ransom costs hard to predict at the time of infection and costs can surge upwards of $28 per transaction, complicating a criminal campaign.
The volatility made mining, the act of using system resources to “mint” cryptocurrency, exceedingly difficult and raised transaction prices.
This was especially true for Bitcoin, due its high hash rate of the network.
(The higher the hash rate, the more people they compete against.)
Cybercriminals will always seek to combine the highest returns in the shortest time with the least risk.
