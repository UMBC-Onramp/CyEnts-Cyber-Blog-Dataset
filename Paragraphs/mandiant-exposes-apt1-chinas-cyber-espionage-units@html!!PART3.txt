The scale and impact of APT1's operations compelled us to write this report.
The decision to publish a significant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one.
What started as a \"what if\" discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk of losing much of our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group.
