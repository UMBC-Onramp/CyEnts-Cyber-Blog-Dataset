By Christiaan Beek and John Fokker on Jul 13, 2018 How often do we get a chance to learn what goes on in the minds of cybercriminals?
Two members of McAfeeâ€™s Advanced Threat Research team recently did, as they attended a court case against two cybercriminal brothers.
The brothers, Dennis and Melvin, faced a judge in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.
This case was one of the first in the world in which ransomware developers appeared in court and were convicted for creating and spreading ransomware.
They were responsible for creating the ransomware families CoinVault and BitCryptor .
CoinVault, the better known of the two, made its appearance in late 2014.
The technically skilled programmers had examined the source code of CryptoLocker, the notorious ransomware family that first struck in 2013.
The brothers were not very impressed and agreed that they could do a better job.
What might have started out as a fun technical challenge turned into a criminal business.
The CoinVault and BitCryptor campaigns were not as widespread as CTB-Locker, CryptoWall, or Locky ransomware campaigns.
