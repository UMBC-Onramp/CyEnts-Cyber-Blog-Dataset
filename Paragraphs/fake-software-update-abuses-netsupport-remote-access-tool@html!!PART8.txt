It sets the attribute’s execution policy to bypass and window-style to hidden to hide itself from the end user.
Components of the Attack Figure 7 shows the index of the malicious server where we have observed the malware author updating the script content.
Figure 7:
Index of Malicious Server 7za.exe: 7zip standalone executable LogList.rtf: Password-protected archive file Upd.cmd: Batch script to install the NetSupport Client Downloads.txt: List of IPs (possibly the infected systems)
Get.php:
Downloads LogList.rtf Upd.cmd
This file is a batch script that extracts the archive file and installs the remote control tool on the system.
The script is obfuscated with the variable substitution method.
This file was regularly updated by the malware during our analysis.
After de-obfuscating the script, we can see the batch commands in the script (Figure 8).
Figure 8: De-Obfuscated Upd.cmd Script The script performs the following tasks: Extract the archive using the 7zip executable with the password mentioned in the script.
After extraction, delete the downloaded archive file (loglist.rtf).
Disable Windows Error Reporting and App Compatibility.
Add the remote control client executable to the firewall’s allowed program list.
Run remote control tool (client32.exe).
Add Run registry entry with the name “ManifestStore” or downloads shortcut file to Startup folder.
Hide the files using attributes.
Delete all the artifacts (7zip executable, script, archive file).
Note: While analyzing the script, we found some typos in the script (Figure 9).
Yes, malware authors make mistakes too.
This script might be in beta phase.
In the later version of script, the author has removed these typos.
