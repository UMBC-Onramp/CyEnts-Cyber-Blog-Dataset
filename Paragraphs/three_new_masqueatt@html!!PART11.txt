We independently discovered that the extension within an iOS 8 app\ncould either gain full access to other appsâ€™ data containers or\nprevent other apps from accessing their own data containers, as long\nas the extension uses the same bundle identifier as the target app.
An\nattacker can lure a victim to install an in-house app using enterprise\nprovisioning from a website and to enable the malicious extension of\nthe in-house app on his/her device.
The effect of such attack is related to the installation sequence of\nthe malicious extension and the target app.
Note that an extension\ncannot be installed standalone; it must be distributed as a part of an\napp.
So in the following content when we refer to installing an\nextension we mean installing an app carrying that extension.
