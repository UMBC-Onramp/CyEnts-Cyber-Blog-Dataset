Here is what an initial IOC looks like: Figure 1: Initial IOC for acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR)
As analysis continues, these IOCs are updated and improved - incorporating indicator terms from malware and intelligence analysis as well as being refined based on the environment.
In this sense, the IOC is a living document.
For example, additional analysis may reveal more registry key information, additional files which may be written to disk, or information for identifying the malware in memory.
Here is the same IOC, after augmenting it with the results of malware analysis:
