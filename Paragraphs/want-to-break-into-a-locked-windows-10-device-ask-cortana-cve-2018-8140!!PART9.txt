With the file indexed we have multiple options to proceed.
Option 1: Drop an Executable File This method assumes you can write an executable file to the disk; it does not require you to have executed it.
Via a phishing attack or another vulnerability, an attacker could drop a backdoor (for example, Cobalt Strike Beacon or Meterpreter) and be in business.
If you need to execute the payload as an administrator, you can simply right-click (for a touchscreen this is a longer-hold screen press) and select “Run as administrator.”
When running applications that do not have the Auto-Elevate Privilege, you will trigger a user account control (UAC) prompt and nothing will execute.
This could still result in a valid attack because users rarely check the content of the prompt and often proceed through the warning dialog box.
The attacker would have to execute the program, and then wait for the authenticated user to log in and finish the job.
