Figure 6: DEWMODE cleanup request Mandiant also identified a variant of DEWMODE ( bdfd11b1b092b7c61ce5f02ffc5ad55a ) which contained minor changes to the cleanup operation, including wiping of /var/log/secure and removing about.html and oauth.api from the directories /home/httpd/html/ instead of /home/seos/courier/ .
In a subset of incidents, Mandiant observed UNC2546 requesting a file named cache.js.gz (Figure 7).
Based on temporal file access to the mysqldump utility and mysql data directories, the archive likely contained a dump of the database.
