FireEye Email Security recently encountered various phishing campaigns, mostly in the Americas and Europe, using source code obfuscation with compromised or bad domains.
These domains were masquerading as authentic websites and stole personal information such as credit card data.
The stolen information was then shared to cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging applications.
Coming off a busy holiday season with a massive surge in deliveries, this post highlights a phishing campaign involving a fake DHL tracking page.
While phishing attacks targeting users of shipping services is not new, the techniques used in these examples are more complex than what would be found in an off-the-shelf phishing kit.
This campaign uses a WOFF-based substitution cypher, localization specific targeting, and various evasion techniques which we unravel here in this blog.
Attack Flow The attack starts with an email imitating DHL, as seen in Figure 1 .
The email tries to trick the recipient into clicking on a link, which would take them to a fake DHL website.
In Figure 2, we can see the fake page asking for credit card details that, if submitted, would give the user a generic response while in the background the credit card data is shared with the attackers.
