Although one reaction is to marvel at the level of innovation displayed by the threat actor(s), we are not discussing five new, never-before-seen malware variants—rather the reuse of code from implants seen eight years prior.
The Oceansalt malware uses large parts of code from the Seasalt implant, which was linked to the Chinese hacking group Comment Crew.
The level of reuse is graphically depicted below: Code Visualization of Recent Oceansalt with Older Seasalt Oceansalt, 2018.

Who is Behind the Oceansalt Attack?
Originally taking the title APT1, the Comment Crew was seen as the threat actor conducting offensive cyber operations against the United States almost 10 years before.
The obvious suspect is Comment Crew and, although this may seem a logical conclusion, we have not seen any activity from this group since they were initially exposed.
Is it possible that this group has returned and, if so, why target South Korea?
It is possible that the source code developed by Comment Crew has now been used by another adversary.
