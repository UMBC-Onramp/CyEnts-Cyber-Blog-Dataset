In this blog post, we will demonstrate how the FireEye Data Science (FDS) and FireEye Labs Reverse Engineering (FLARE) teams recently collaborated to streamline this analyst pain point using machine learning.
Highlights Running the Strings program on a piece of malware inevitably produces noisy strings mixed in with important ones, which can only be uncovered after sifting and scrolling through the entirety of its messy output.
FireEyeâ€™s new machine learning model that automatically ranks strings based on their relevance for malware analysis speeds up this process at scale.
Knowing which individual strings are relevant often requires highly experienced analysts.
Quality, security-relevant labeled training data can be time consuming and expensive to obtain, but weak supervision that leverages the domain expertise of reverse engineers helps accelerate this bottleneck.
Our proposed learning-to-rank model can efficiently prioritize Strings outputs from individual malware samples.
