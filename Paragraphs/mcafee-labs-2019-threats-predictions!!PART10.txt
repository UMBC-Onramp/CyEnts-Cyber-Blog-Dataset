Credit card fraud and the demand for stolen credit card details will continue, with an increased focus on online skimming operations that target third-party payment platforms on large e-commerce sites.
From these sites, criminals can silently steal thousands of fresh credit cards details at a time.
Furthermore, social media is being used to recruit unwitting users, who might not know they are working for criminals when they reship goods or provide financial services.
We predict an increase in the market for stolen credentialsâ€”fueled by recent large data breaches and by bad password habits of users.
