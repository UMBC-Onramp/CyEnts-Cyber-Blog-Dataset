It is unusual for Chinese espionage actors to remove a large number of backdoors across several victim environments on or around the time of public disclosure.
This action displays an interesting concern for operational security and a sensitivity to publicity.
Both UNC2630 and UNC2717 display advanced tradecraft and go to impressive lengths to avoid detection.
The actors modify file timestamps and regularly edit or delete forensic evidence such as logs, web server core dumps, and files staged for exfiltration.
They also demonstrate a deep understanding of network appliances and advanced knowledge of a targeted network.
This tradecraft can make it difficult for network defenders to establish a complete list of tools used, credentials stolen, the initial intrusion vector, or the intrusion start date.
