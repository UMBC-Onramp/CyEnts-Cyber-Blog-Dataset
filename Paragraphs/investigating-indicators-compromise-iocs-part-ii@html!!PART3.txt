About seven minutes, later the registry recorded the modification of a Run key associated with persistence for \"msspcheck.exe.\" Finally, at 16:48:11 UTC, the attacker logged off from \"ACMWH-KIOSK\".
John found no additional evidence of compromise.

John updates the \"acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR)\" IOC with information from the \"msspcheck.exe\" variant of the attacker's backdoor including: File metadata like filename and MD5.
A uniquely named process handle discovered by John's malware analyst.
A prefetch entry for the \"msspcheck.exe\" binary.
