As soon as the player selected the desired item, the script redirects the query to an identical product that the scammer is selling for 10,000 coins.
At the same time, the script replaces the system message confirming the purchase with a fake one, showing the original price, say 5 coins.
That way, despite making and confirming a small purchase, the player finds their account has been charged 10,000 instead.
