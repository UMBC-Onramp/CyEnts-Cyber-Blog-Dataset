Unfortunately, not every function was as simple as canioWriteOutput.
For example, when reversing the functions used to control analog outputs, we noticed that they utilized custom data structures to hold various information about the analog device, including its state.
As a result, we had to first reverse the layout of these data structures to understand how the analog information was being sent to the outputs before we could modify their state.
