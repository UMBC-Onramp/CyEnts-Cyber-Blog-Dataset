The vulnerability here is that the offset (0x51) used for verification is smaller than the offset (0x54) used to advance the buffer pointer.
This error provides a 3 byte out of bound read and write.
The fix for this was pretty straight forwardâ€”change the verification offset to 0x54, which is how Microsoft fixed this bug.
