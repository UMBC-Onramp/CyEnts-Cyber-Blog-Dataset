We can make similar observations about the patient monitor’s broadcast packets, including the 10-second time delay and patient data in plaintext.
In these packets we see that the source port is incrementing but the destination port, 7000, is the same as the central monitoring station’s.
  After reviewing many of these packets, we find that offset 0x34 of the payload has a counter that increments by 0xA, or 10, with each packet.
Without potentially damaging the patient monitor, there is no good way to extract the firmware to review its code.
However, the central monitoring station must have code to receive these packets.
With a bit of digging through the central station’s binaries, we found the section parsing the broadcast packets from the patient monitor.
The first line of code parses the payload of the packet plus 12 bytes.
If we count in 12 bytes from the payload on the Wireshark capture, we can see the start of the patient data in clear text.
