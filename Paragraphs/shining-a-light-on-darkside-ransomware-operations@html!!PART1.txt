Update (May 14):
Â Mandiant has observed multiple actors cite a May 13 announcement that appeared to be shared with DARKSIDE RaaS affiliates by the operators of the service.
This announcement stated that they lost access to their infrastructure, including their blog, payment, and CDN servers, and would be closing their service.
Decrypters would also be provided for companies who have not paid, possibly to their affiliates to distribute.
The post cited law enforcement pressure and pressure from the United States for this decision.
We have not independently validated these claims and there is some speculation by other actors that this could be an exit scam.
