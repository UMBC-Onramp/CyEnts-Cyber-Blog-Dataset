The John Turner persona has been active since at least 2015.
Turner has claimed to be based, variously, in New York, NY, Seattle, WA, and Washington, DC.
Turner described himself as a journalist in his Twitter profile, though has also claimed both to work at the Seattle Times and to be a student at Villanova University, claiming to be attending between 2015 and 2020.
