Conclusion In this blog post, we demonstrated how to fine-tune a neural LM on open source datasets containing social media posts previously leveraged in information operations.
Transfer learning allowed us to classify these posts with a high AUC score, and FireEye’s Threat Analysts can utilize this detection capability in order to discover and triage similar emergent operations.
Additionally, we showed how Transformer models assign scores to different pieces of text via an attention mechanism.
This visualization can be used by analysts to tease apart adversary tradecraft based on posts’ linguistic fingerprints and semantic stylings.
