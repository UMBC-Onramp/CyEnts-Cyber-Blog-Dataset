In all cases, the attack was accomplished in Google Chrome.
In principle, several unique features of the browser make Spook.js possible.
Other Chromium-based browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, are also vulnerable to this attack.
However, there are certain limitations.
First is the low speed of data theft (400â€“600 bytes per second, depending on the CPU), which is why the target file in the last demo is very small.
Second is the large number of errors when stealing data from the CPU cache.
Up to 4% of the data is erroneous; hence the artifacts in the stolen copy of the image.
