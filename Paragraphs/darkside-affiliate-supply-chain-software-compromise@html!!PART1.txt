Mandiant observed DARKSIDE affiliate UNC2465
accessing at least one victim through a Trojanized software installer downloaded from a legitimate website.
While this victim organization detected the intrusion, engaged Mandiant for incident response, and avoided ransomware, others may be at risk.
As reported in the Mandiant post, \" Shining a Light on DARKSIDE Ransomware Operations ,\" Mandiant Consulting has investigated intrusions involving several DARKSIDE affiliates.
UNC2465 is one of those DARKSIDE affiliates that Mandiant believes has been active since at least March 2020.
The intrusion that is detailed in this post began on May 18, 2021, which occurred days after the publicly reported shutdown of the overall DARKSIDE program ( Mandiant Advantage background ).
