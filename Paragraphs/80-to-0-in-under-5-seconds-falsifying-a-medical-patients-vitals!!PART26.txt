The hospital could also suffer resource consumption.”
 Dr. Nordeck explained that short changes to a heartbeat would generally trigger the nurse or technician monitoring the central station to page a doctor.
The doctor would typically ask for a printout from the central station to review the rhythm.
The doctor might also order an additional test, such as an EKG, to verify the rhythm.
An EKG, however, would not likely capture an abnormal rhythm if it is intermittent, but the test might reveal an underlying cause for intermittent arrythmia.
Should the rhythm recur intermittently throughout the day, the doctor might make treatment decisions based on this erroneous printout.
The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology publish guidelines that hospitals are to follow, including for “intermittent cardiac rhythms,” seen in this chart: A decision tree for treating an intermittent heart rate.
