Their activity was first reported by FireEye Threat Intelligence in early 2018.
They gradually increased in sophistication and leveraged both custom and open-source malware.
The 2018 campaign used standalone EXE or self-extracting RAR (SFX) files to infect victims.
However, their recent activity showed increased sophistication by leveraging malicious LNK files.
The group used open-source QUASARRAT and the RATVERMIN malware, which we have not seen used by any other groups.
Domain resolutions and malware compile times suggest this group may have been active as early as 2014.
