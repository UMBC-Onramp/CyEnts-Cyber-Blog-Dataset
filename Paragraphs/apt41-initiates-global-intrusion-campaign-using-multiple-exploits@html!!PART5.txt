While it is possible that this reduction in activity might be related to the COVID-19 quarantine measures in China, APT41 may have remained active in other ways, which we were unable to observe with FireEye telemetry.
We observed a significant uptick in CVE-2019-19781 exploitation on February 24 and February 25.
The exploit behavior was almost identical to the activity on February 1, where only the name of the payload ‘un’ changed.
