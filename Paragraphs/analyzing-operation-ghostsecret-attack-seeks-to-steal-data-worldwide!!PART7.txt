Proxysvc was first collected by public and private sources on March 22 from an unknown entity in the United States.
The executable dropper for the component was submitted from South Korea on March 19.
McAfee telemetry analysis from March 16 to 21 reveals that Proxysvc components were active in the wild.
Our research shows this listener component appeared mostly in higher education organizations.
We suspect this component is involved in core control server infrastructure.
These targets were chosen intentionally to run Proxysvc because the attacker would have needed to know which systems were infected to connect to them.
This data also indicates this infrastructure had been operating for more than a year before its discovery.
