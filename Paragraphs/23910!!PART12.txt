Apple didn’t invent cyberstalking, but it did come up with a convenient technology that enables people to engage in illegal stalking.
That means that it’s the company’s responsibility to make it harder for people to use the device for objectionable purposes.
Once again, the closed ecosystem of Apple’s software and devices has come under criticism.
If you have an iPhone and someone has snuck an AirTag into your bag, your phone will notify you.
But what if you don’t have an iPhone?
For the time being, Apple has developed a band-aid solution by releasing an app for Android smartphones that you need to install to detect tracking.
The upshot is that Apple created a problem for everyone but offered a simple solution only to its own customers.
