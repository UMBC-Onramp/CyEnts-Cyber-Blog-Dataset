Figure 3: Starting emulation API Hooks
The Speakeasy framework ships with support for hundreds of Windows APIs with more being added frequently.
This is accomplished via Python API handlers defined in appropriate files in the speakeasy/winenv/api directory.
API hooks can be installed to have your own code executed when particular APIs are called during emulation.
They can be installed for any API, regardless of whether a handler exists or not.
An API hook can be used to override an existing handler and that handler can optionally be invoked from your hook.
