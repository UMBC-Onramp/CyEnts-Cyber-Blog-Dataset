After boot completes, create a malicious init script in /etc/
init.d/ as the python user.
Reboot the X2e, forcing the system to execute the new init script.
While not the cleanest approach (it requires two reboots), it accomplishes the goal of achieving code execution as root .
Figure 10 shows the output of our proof of concept.
In this case, our malicious init script spawned a bind shell on TCP port 8080, so that we could connect in as root .
