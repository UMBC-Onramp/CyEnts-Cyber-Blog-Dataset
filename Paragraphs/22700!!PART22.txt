The Transform Hospital Group cosmetic surgery chain was the victim of one of the most high-profile incidents of 2020.
The REvil hacker group encrypted and stole 900GB of Transform’s data , including pre- and post-operation photographs of patients, which the attackers threatened to publish.
In addition, cryptomalware operators adopted a range of new tactics in 2020.
For example, the REvil group started auctioning off stolen information.
Cybercriminals have also united into cartel-type organizations.
The first was the Maze group, which began posting information stolen by the LockBit cryptor.
According to the cybercriminals , they are now working closely with LockBit, providing their platform for data leakage as well as sharing their knowledge.
They also boasted that another notable group would soon be joining the cartel: RagnarLocker, a trailblazer in organizing DDoS attacks on victims’ resources as an additional lever of pressure on companies it extorts.
Conclusion In a span of three decades, ransomware has evolved from a relatively harmless toy into a serious threat to users of all platforms, and especially to businesses.
To guard against attacks, be sure to observe a few security rules — and if somehow, a hack succeeds, it is important to seek help from experts and not simply do the cybercriminals’ bidding.
