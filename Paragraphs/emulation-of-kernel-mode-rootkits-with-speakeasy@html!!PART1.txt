In August 2020, we released a blog post about how the Speakeasy emulation framework can be used to emulate user mode malware such as shellcode.
If you haven’t had a chance, give the post a read today .
In addition to user mode emulation, Speakeasy also supports emulation of kernel mode Windows binaries.
When malware authors employ kernel mode malware, it will often be in the form of a device driver whose end goal is total compromise of an infected system.
The malware most often doesn’t interact with hardware and instead leverages kernel mode to fully compromise the system and remain hidden.
Challenges With Dynamically Analyzing Kernel Malware
Ideally, a kernel mode sample can be reversed statically using tools such as disassemblers.
However, binary packers just as easily obfuscate kernel malware as they do user mode samples.
Additionally, static analysis is often expensive and time consuming.
If our goal is to automatically analyze many variants of the same malware family, it makes sense to dynamically analyze malicious driver samples.
