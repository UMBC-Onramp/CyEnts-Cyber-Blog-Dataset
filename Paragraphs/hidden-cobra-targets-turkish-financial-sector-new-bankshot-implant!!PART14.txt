Connections The US government reports that Bankshot is used by Hidden Cobra to target multiple industries including financial organizations.
This implant has been connected to a major Korean bank attack and is also known as Trojan Manuscript.
That variant contained the capability to search for hosts related to the SWIFT network and the same control server strings as the variant we found targeting the Turkish financial sector.
The implant does not conduct financial transactions; rather it is a channel into the victim’s environment, in which further stages of implants can be deployed for financial reconnaissance.
The Bankshot implant was also observed in 2017 in documents appearing to come from Latin American banks.
Malicious document delivering the Bankshot implant in 2017.
These connections, combined with the implant’s nearly identical appearance to known variants, are a strong indication that we have uncovered a Hidden Cobra attack.
Further, previous implants from 2017 contained bogus documents with financially themed content.

Conclusion We have found what may be an early data-gathering stage for future possible heists from financial organizations in Turkey (and possibly other countries).
In this campaign, we see the adoption of a recent zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability to get the implant onto the victim’s systems.
The campaign has a high chance of success against victims who have an unpatched version of Flash.
Documents with the Flash exploit managed to evade static defenses and remain undetected as an exploit on VirusTotal.
