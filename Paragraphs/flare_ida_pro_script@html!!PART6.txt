The sample\nscript merely prints this information out, but real scripts would\nbegin actual analysis with these results.
The reason that getPushArgs() returns a\nlist is for situations like in Figure 3, where separate code paths can\nsetup function arguments to a single call instruction.
Each entry in\nthe result list contains the complete set of arguments if the\ndifferent code paths were taken.
Figure 3: Multipath argtracker handling For a more complex example, suppose you have an annoying piece of\nmalware that decodes all of its strings at runtime.
