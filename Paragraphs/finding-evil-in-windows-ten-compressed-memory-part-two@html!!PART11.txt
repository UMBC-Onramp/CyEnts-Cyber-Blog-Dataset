The decoding of the chunk key in Figure 9 allowed us to find all the information to derive the virtual address of our compressed page.
The retrieved REGION_KEY ( 0xf72397 , in our case) is also a compound value that encodes the index within the SMKM_STORE ’s region pointer array, as well as the offset within the region of pages.
To calculate this data, we parse the region key with the help of two fields inside the ST_DATA_MGR structure – dwRegionIndexMask and dwRegionSizeMask .
