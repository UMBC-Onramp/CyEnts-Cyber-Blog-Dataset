How to Repair a Damaged MBR Fixing an MBR is relatively easy in modern Windows.
After the affected machine reboots (sometimes it requires a few reboots), the system enters automatic repair mode.
First, choose Advanced Options, Troubleshoot.
Another Advanced Option should then let you use the Command Prompt.
From the Command Prompt, type and run \"bootrec.exe /fixmbr\".
An alternative and more straightforward option would be to choose Startup Repair on the screen to run the Command Prompt.
The downside of selecting Startup Repair is that it will take longer to complete the job.
If the automatic repair mode does not kick in for some reason, you'll need to boot the system off a recovery disk or drive.
