To learn more about these and capa’s rule syntax see the rule format documentation on GitHub.
Unfortunately, rules with these new features are not backwards compatible with older versions of capa.
Therefore, you should prefer to upgrade your capa installation to take advantage of our enhanced rules.
Substring Features To make many rules easier to read, we’ve added a convenience feature named substring that acts like a literal string match with implied leading and trailing wildcards.
This makes it easier to match file path components, such as /.ssh/id_rsa .
Previously, users had to wrap a substring with forward slashes and escape special characters with backslashes, leading to nearly incomprehensible character sequences.
Now, a substring feature clearly describes a literal string found as part of a longer string.
Figure 3 shows how much easier it is to read a substring feature.
