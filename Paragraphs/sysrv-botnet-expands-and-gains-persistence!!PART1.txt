On March 4, 2021, Juniper Threat Labs identified a surge of activity of the Sysrv botnet.
The botnet spread itself into Windows and Linux systems by exploiting multiple vulnerabilities, which we will cover in this blog.
The threat actor’s objective is to install a Monero cryptominer.
The attack remains active.
Here’s what we’ve seen so far.
Sysrv Botnet Development Juniper Threat Labs monitored the Sysrv botnet since December of 2020.
At that time, it used two mining pools, minexmr and f2pool .
It also used multi-component malware wherein the worm binary is installed as sysrv ( sysrv.exe on Windows) and the miner binary as network01 (network01.exe on Windows).
