This variant also forks itself with the process name “/usr/sbin*” to try to look like a normal process while wiping out the original file, “macHelper”.
Since it is based on Mirai, the botnet also contains a data section to store its configuration.
The plaintext configuration can be decoded after XOR with 0x22:
After getting the C2 server (life.zerobytes[.]cc) from its configuration, it starts sending heartbeat (\\x00\\x00) packets and then waits for the next control command from the C2 server.
Once the victim system receives the command, it starts a DDoS attack to a specific IP address and port number.
One example of the DDoS attack traffic is shown below: The DDoS attack command is 24 bytes and can be seen in the Data section in Figure 8.
This detail is illustrated in the following figure, which includes the flood method and the target IP/Port.
Except for SYN flood, the C2 server has other attacking commands, such as 0x06 for UDP flood, 0x04 for ACK flood, and 0x05 for ACK+PUSH flood.
