We focused on the “pos.exe” malware and suspected that it maybe targeted Point of Sale machines.
We speculate that once the attackers have identified a potentially interesting host form among their victims, they can then instruct the victim to download the POS malware.
While we have observed many downloads of the various EXE’s hosed on that server, we have only observed three downloads of “pos.exe”.
