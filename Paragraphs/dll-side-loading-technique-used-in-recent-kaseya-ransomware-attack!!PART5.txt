This trick also makes deeper analysis take longer because analysts are blind as to which APIs they need to be looking for.
Looking deeper, these initial APIs are not very important to the malware.
Instead, it resolves its needed APIs using a simple hashing computation.
The malware includes a list of hash values that correspond to the APIs it needs.
It first resolves the LoadLibraryA API to load the needed DLL file.
It grabs the first available API name from the loaded library, calculates the hash, and then compares it to the current API hash.
If it is the right hash, it gets the index of the API name and the API address pointed to by the index.
