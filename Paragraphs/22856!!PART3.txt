According to Bleeping Computer , the operators of Conti ransomware contacted HSE representatives and demanded almost $20 million in ransom.
The crooks claimed that they had been present in HSE’s network for more than two weeks before encrypting any data, that they’d downloaded approximately 700GB of unencrypted files — including personal data, contracts, and financial documents — and that they’d publish the information if their terms weren’t met.

Ireland’s prime minister refused to pay that ransom, a decision we fully support .
