VictimUser REG_SZ Since these raw artifact data sets have different column headings and data types, they would be difficult to review in one timeline.
If we format the data using Excel string concatenation, we can make the data easy to combine into a single timeline view.
To format the data, we can use the “&” operation with a function to join information we may need into a “Summary” field.
An example command to join the relevant file system data delimited by ampersands could be “=D2 & \" | \" & C2 & \" | \" & E2 & \" | \" & F2 & \" | \" & G2 & \" | \" & H2”.
Combining this format function with a “Timestamp” and “Timestamp Type” column will complete everything we need for streamlined analysis.
