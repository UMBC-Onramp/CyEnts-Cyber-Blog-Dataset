Third-party libraries, especially ad libraries, are widely used in Android apps.
Unfortunately, many of them have security and privacy issues.
In this blog, we summarize our findings related to the insecure usage of JavaScript binding in ad libraries.
First, we describe a widespread security issue with using JavaScript binding ( addJavascriptInterface ) and loading WebView content over HTTP, which allows a network attacker to take control of the application by hijacking the HTTP traffic.
We call this the JavaScript-Binding-Over-HTTP (JS-Binding-Over-HTTP) vulnerability.
Our analysis shows that, currently, at least 47 percent of the top 40 ad libraries have this vulnerability in at least one of their versions that are in active use by popular apps on Google Play.
