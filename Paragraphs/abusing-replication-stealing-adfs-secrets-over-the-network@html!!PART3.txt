AD FS verifies a user’s identity and issues assertions that describe the user.
Microsoft 365  trusts AD FS to verify user identities and provide it with assertions.
To Microsoft 365, it doesn’t matter how AD FS performed the verification, it just needs the assertions.
In the typical deployment (Figure 1), AD FS will verify a user’s identity using Active Directory.
At a minimum, an AD FS deployment consists of two servers in an enterprise’s on-premises network: the primary AD FS server, and an AD FS Web Application Proxy (WAP).
