FireEye Labs recently observed an attack against the government sector in Central Asia.
The attack involved the new HAWKBALL backdoor being delivered via well-known Microsoft Office vulnerabilities CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802.
HAWKBALL is a backdoor that attackers can use to collect information from the victim, as well as to deliver payloads.
HAWKBALL is capable of surveying the host, creating a named pipe to execute native Windows commands, terminating processes, creating, deleting and uploading files, searching for files, and enumerating drives.
Figure 1 shows the decoy used in the attack.
