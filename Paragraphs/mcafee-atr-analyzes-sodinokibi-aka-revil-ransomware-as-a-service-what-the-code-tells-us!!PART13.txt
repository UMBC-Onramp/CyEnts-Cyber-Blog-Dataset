If the exploit works, it will elevate the process to SYSTEM user.

It is the template for the image that the malware will create in runtime to change the wallpaper of the desktop with this text.
After decrypting the malware config, it parses it and the malware will check the “exp” field and if the value is ‘true’, it will detect the type of the operative system using the PEB fields that reports the major and minor version of the OS.
FIGURE 6.
CHECK OF THE VERSION OF THE OPERATIVE SYSTEM Usually only one OS can be found but that is enough for the malware.
The malware will check the file-time to verify if the date was before or after a patch was installed to fix the exploit.
If the file time is before the file time of the patch, it will check if the OS is 64-bit or 32-bit using the function “GetSystemNativeInfoW”.
When the OS system is 32-bit, it will use a shellcode embedded in the malware that is the exploit and, in the case of a 64-bit OS, it will use another shellcode that can use a “Heaven´s Gate” to execute code of 64 bits in a process of 32 bits.
