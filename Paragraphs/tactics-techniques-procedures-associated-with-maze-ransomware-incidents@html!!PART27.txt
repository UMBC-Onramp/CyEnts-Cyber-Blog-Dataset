Maze MITRE ATT&CK Mappings Mandiant currently tracks three separate clusters of activity involved in the post-compromise distribution of MAZE ransomware.
Future data collection and analysis efforts may reveal additional groups involved in intrusion activity supporting MAZE operations, or may instead allow us to collapse some of these groups into larger clusters.
It should also be noted that ‘initial access’ phase techniques have been included in these mappings, though in some cases this access may have been provided by a separate threat actor(s).
