In the case of RC4 encryption, the user's RC4 Kerberos key is directly derived from the user's account password.
In the case of AES encryption, the user's Kerberos key is derived from the user's password and a salt based on the username and domain name).
The domain controller receives the request and decrypts the timestamp by looking up the user's Kerberos key.
An example AS-REQ packet is shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5: AS-REQ Once preauthentication is successful, the Domain Controller issues an AS-REP response packet that contains various metadata fields, the TGT itself, and an \"Authenticator\".
The data within the TGT itself is considered sensitive.
If a user could freely modify the content within the TGT, they could impersonate any user in the domain as performed in the Golden Ticket attack.
To prevent this from easily occurring, the TGT is encrypted with the long term Kerberos key stored on the Domain Controller.
This key is derived from the password of the krbtgt account in Active Directory.
To prevent users from impersonating another user with a stolen TGT blob, Active Directoryâ€™s Kerberos implementation uses session keys that are used for mutual authentication between the user, domain, and service.
