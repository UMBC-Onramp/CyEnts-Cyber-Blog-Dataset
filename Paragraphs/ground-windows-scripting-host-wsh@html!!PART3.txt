I often see the startup folder used legitimately to execute maintenance scripts written in Visual Basic or in Microsoft's batch scripting language.
I also frequently see that applications install shortcut, or LNK, files within the startup folder that point to applications on disk.
Malicious use of this directory, however, is most often associated with commodity malware - often accomplished by dropping an executable into the startup folder.
