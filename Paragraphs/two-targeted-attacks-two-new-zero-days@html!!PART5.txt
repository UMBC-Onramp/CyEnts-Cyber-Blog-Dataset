The remainder of the font program section is treated as unreachable code for the purposes of the font program and is ignored when initially parsing the font.
During exploitation, the attacker’s shellcode uses Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC) to inject the second stage from kernel-mode into the user-mode process winlogon.exe (in XP) or lsass.exe (in other OSes).
From the injected process, the attacker writes and executes a third stage (executable).
The third stage decodes an embedded DLL to, and runs it from, memory.
This DLL is a full-featured remote access tool that connects back to the attacker.
Plenty of evidence supports the attacker’s high level of sophistication.
