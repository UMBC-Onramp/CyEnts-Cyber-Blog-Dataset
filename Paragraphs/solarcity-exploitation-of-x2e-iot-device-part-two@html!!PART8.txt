Figure 5 shows the device powering on with the metal tweezers connecting I/O0 to GND .
Figure 5:
Shorting I/O0 to GND While connected to the UART interface, we noted several different outcomes.
When shorting the pin immediately after powering on, the device failed to produce any output or boot.
When shorting after the bootloader finished loading (and handing off to the Linux kernel), the device would also force reboot.
However, when timed perfectly between the bootloader loading and attempting to read its configuration, we noted that the bootloader would present different output, and the option to interrupt the boot process was possible with a four-second delay.
