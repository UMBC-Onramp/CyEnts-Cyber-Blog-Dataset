A JSON payload is present for all HTTP POST and PUT requests and contains the keys “userId”, “sessionId”, and “steps”.
The “steps” field contains a list of objects with the following keys: “Timestamp”, “Index”, “EventType”, “EventName”, “DurationMs”, “Succeeded”, and “Message”.
The JSON key “EventType” is hardcoded to the value “Orion”, and the “EventName” is hardcoded to “EventManager”.
Malware response messages to send to the server are DEFLATE compressed and single-byte-XOR encoded, then split among the “Message” fields in the “steps” array.
Each “Message” value is Base64 encoded separately.
Not all objects in the “steps” array contribute to the malware message – the integer in the “Timestamp” field must have the 0x2 bit set to indicate that the contents of the “Message” field are used in the malware message.
Step objects whose bit 0x2 is clear in the Timestamp field contain random data and are discarded when assembling the malware response.
