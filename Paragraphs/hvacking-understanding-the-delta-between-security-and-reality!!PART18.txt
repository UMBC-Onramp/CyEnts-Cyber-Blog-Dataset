In scBIPRxTask’s disassembly, we saw a new thread or “task” being created for both BACnet IP interfaces on ports 47808 and 47809.
These spawned threads would handle all the incoming packets on their respective ports.
When a packet would be received by the system, the thread responsible for scBIPRxTask would trigger for each packet.
Using the IDA Pro decompiler, we could see what occurs for each packet.
First, the function uses memset to zero out an allocated buffer on the stack and read from the network socket into this buffer.
This buffer becomes the source for the following memcpy call.
The new buffer is created with a static size of 1732 bytes and only 1732 bytes are appropriately read from the socket.
Figure 13 After reading data from the socket, the function sets up a place to store the packet it has just received.
