I figured this out by modifying its binary data.
The VBA project has a predefined method, Workbook_BeforeClose(), that is automatically called when the victim closes the document.
When called, it displays two UserForms with the string “ERROR!”
one by one.
When the second form is closed, it executes a piece of code loaded from an OptionButton’s tag property.
