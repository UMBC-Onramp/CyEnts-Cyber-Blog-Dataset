Based on our analysis, financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document.
The document contains an embedded Adobe Flash exploit, which was recently announced by the Korean Internet Security agency.
The exploit, which takes advantage of CVE-2018-4878, allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code such as an implant.
the Further investigation into this campaign and analysis of McAfee product telemetry shows that the infection occurred on March 2 and 3.
The implant’s first target was a major government-controlled financial organization.
It next appeared in another Turkish government organization involved in finance and trade.
