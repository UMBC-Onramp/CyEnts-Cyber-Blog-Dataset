This week’s Patch Tuesday from Microsoft contains fixes for these issues under CVE-2018-8140.
This concludes our examination of Cortana (at least for now).
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has a fundamental goal of eliminating critical threats to the hardware and software we use; this month’s patch is a clear step toward furthering that goal.
The attack surface created by vocal commands and personal digital assistants requires much more investigation; we are just scratching the surface of the amount of research that should be conducted in this critical area.
A team of several independent researchers also discovered and disclosed this vulnerability around the time of our submission.
Additional credit for this discovery goes to: Ron Marcovich, Yuval Ron, Amichai Shulman and Tal Be’ery.
Their names are also on the Microsoft disclosure page .
