In the same underground forum thread we found a post from October 22, 2018, mentioning Ryuk.
This post contains a link to an article in the Russian security magazine Xakep.ru (“Hacker”) discussing the emergence of Ryuk and how it was first discovered by MalwareHunterTeam in August 2018.
This first appearance came well before last week’s attack on newspaper printing services.
Manga connection Ryuk, according to Wikipedia, refers to a Japanese manga character from the series “Death Note.”
Ryuk apparently drops a death note, a fitting name for ransomware that drops ransom notes.
Ransomware is typically named by its cybercriminal developer, as opposed to the naming of state-sponsored malware, which is mostly is done by the security industry.
It seems the criminals behind Ryuk are into manga.
The use of manga character names and references is common in the cybercriminal scene.
