After brute-forcing the baud rate, we were able to get debug information via the UART interface.
The UART also provided a login prompt; however, neither online research nor simple guessing led us to a working password.
Extraction and firmware analysis The flash chip discovered on the board was a Maxronix MX25L12835F, which is supported by flashrom, a well-known open-source tool for extracting firmware.
Using flashrom and the XI Breakout board, we extracted the firmware from the Wemo device.
After we obtained the original firmware image shipped with the device, we updated it using the Wemo mobile application.
Once the device was updated, we again extracted the firmware from the device, providing us with a second image.
We ran basic sanity checks with the new firmware to ensure our earlier software reconnaissance had not changed.
With the firmware extracted, we analyzed the firmware using binwalk, an open-source binary analysis tool.
