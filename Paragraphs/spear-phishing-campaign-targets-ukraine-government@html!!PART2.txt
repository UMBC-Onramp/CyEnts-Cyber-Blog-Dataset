The spear phishing email, sent on Jan. 22, 2019, used the subject \"SPEC-20T-MK2-000-ISS-4.10-09-2018-STANDARD,\" and the sender was forged as Armtrac, a defense manufacturer in the United Kingdom (Figure 1).

The spear phishing email
The email included an attachment with the filename \"Armtrac-Commercial.7z\" (MD5: 982565e80981ce13c48e0147fb271fe5).
This 7z package contained \"Armtrac-Commercial.zip\" (MD5: e92d01d9b1a783a23477e182914b2454) with two benign Armtrac documents and one malicious LNK file with a substituted icon (Figure 2).

(MD5: 0d6a46eb0d0148aafb34e287fcafa68f) is a benign document from the official Armtrac website.

Interestingly, while the LNK file used a forged extension to impersonate a PDF document, the icon was replaced with a Microsoft Word document icon.
