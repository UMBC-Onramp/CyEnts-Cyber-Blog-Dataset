This file is an instance of the publicly available Meterpreter backdoor that was uploaded on November 12, 2019.
Additional analysis confirmed that this binary communicated to 45[.]120[.]53[.]214 over TCP port 1234.
Figure 7: VirusTotal graph showing links between resources hosted on or communicating with 45.120.53.214 Within the avpass.exe binary, we found an interesting PDB string that provided more context about the tool’s author: “ C:\\Users\\ragnarok\\source\\repos\\avpass\\Debug\\avpass.pdb ”.
Utilizing ragnarok as a keyword, we pivoted and were able to identify a separate copy of since1969.exe (MD5: 48452dd2506831d0b340e45b08799623) uploaded to VirusTotal on January 23, 2020.
The binary’s compilation timestamp of January 16, 2020, aligns with our earliest detections associated with this threat actor.
Further analysis and sandboxing of this binary brought all the pieces together—this threat actor may have been attempting to deploy ransomware aptly named ‘Ragnarok’.
We’d like to give credit to this Tweet from Karsten Hahn, who identified ragnarok-related about artifacts on January 17, 2020, again aligning with the timeframe of our initial detection.
