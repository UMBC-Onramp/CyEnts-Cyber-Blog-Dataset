Unique reachable with sentry The UR algorithm operates on the currently visible graph, meaning that you can run the UR algorithm repeatedly and nest groups.
Switch Case Groups Creation Switch statements implemented as jump tables appear in the graph as nodes with a large fan-out, as shown in Figure 6.
The SimplifyGraph plug-in detects when the currently selected node has more than two successor nodes and adds a right-click menu option “SimplifyGraph -> Create switch case subgraphs”.
Selecting this runs the Unique-Reachable algorithm on each separate case branch and automatically uses IDA’s branch label as the group node text.

Switch jumptable use Figure 7 shows a before and after graph overview of the same function when the switch-case grouping is run.
