Getting and Installing FakeNet-NG on Linux If you are running REMnux , then good news: REMnux now comes with FakeNet-NG installed, and existing users can get it by running the update-remnux command.
For other Linux distributions, setting up and using FakeNet-NG will require the Python pip package manager, the net-tools package, and the development files for OpenSSL, libffi , and libnetfilterqueue .
Here is how to quickly obtain the appropriate prerequisites for a few common Linux distributions: Debian and Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev net-tools Fedora 25 and CentOS 7: yum -y update; yum -y install epel-release; # <-- If CentOS yum -y install redhat-rpm-config; # <-- If Fedora yum -y groupinstall 'Development Tools'; yum -y install python-pip python-devel openssl-devel libffi-devel libnetfilter_queue-devel net-tools Once you have the prerequisites, you can download the latest version of FakeNet-NG and install it using setup.py install .
