These signatures have since been deployed and discovered new malware samples.
We answered a number of our own general research questions about PDB paths, and were able to dispel some theories we had not fully tested with data.
While building an independent classifier was not the primary goal, improvements can surely be made to improve the end model accuracy.
Generating an even larger, more diverse dataset would likely make the biggest impact on our accuracy, recall, and precision.
Further hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering could also help.
There is a large amount of established research into text classification using various deep learning methods such as LSTMs , which could be applied effectively to a larger dataset.
PDB paths are only one small family of file paths that we encounter in the field of cyber security.
Whether in initial infection, staging, or another part of the attack lifecycle, the file paths found during forensic analysis can reveal incredibly useful information about adversary activity.
We look forward to further community research on how to properly extract and represent that information.
