Figure 4: Global variables renamed Stack Strings
Our next example is a typical issue when dealing with malware: stack strings .
This is a technique aimed to make the analysis harder by using arrays of characters instead of strings in the code.
An example can be seen in Figure 5; the malware stores each character’s ASCII value in the stack and then references it in the call to sprintf .
At a first glance, it’s very difficult to say what is the meaning of this string (unless of course, you know the ASCII table by heart).

Stack strings are difficult to read.
Our script will modify these assignments to something more readable.
