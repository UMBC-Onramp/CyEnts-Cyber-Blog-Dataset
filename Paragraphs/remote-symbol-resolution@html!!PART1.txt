Introduction The following blog discusses a couple of common techniques that malware uses to obscure its access to the Windows API.
In both forms examined, analysts must calculate the API start address and resolve the symbol from the runtime process in order to determine functionality.
After introducing the techniques, we present an open source tool we developed that can be used to resolve addresses from a process running in a virtual machine by an IDA script.
This gives us an efficient way to quickly add readability back into the disassembly.
Techniques When performing an analysis, it is very common to see malware try to obscure the API it uses.
