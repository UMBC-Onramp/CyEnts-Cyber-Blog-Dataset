Mitigation To bypass Windows’ Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protections, this exploit targets computers with any of the following configurations: Windows XP Windows 7 and Java 1.6 Windows 7 and an out-of-date version of Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 Users can mitigate the threat by upgrading from Windows XP and updating Java and Office.
If you have Java 1.6, update Java to the latest 1.7 version.
If you are using an out-of-date Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010, update Microsoft Office to the latest version.
These mitigations do not patch the underlying vulnerability.
But by breaking the exploit’s ASLR-bypass measures, they do prevent the current in-the-wild exploit from functioning.
Vulnerability analysis GreedyWonk targets a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash.
The vulnerability permits an attacker to overwrite the vftable pointer of a Flash object to redirect code execution.
ASLR bypass The attack uses only known ASLR bypasses.
Details of these techniques are available from our previous blog post on the subject (in the “Non-ASLR modules” section).
For Windows XP, the attackers build a return-oriented programming (ROP) chain of MSVCRT (Visual C runtime) gadgets with hard-coded base addresses for English (“en”) and Chinese (“zh-cn” and “zh-tw”).
On Windows 7, the attackers use a hard-coded ROP chain for MSVCR71.dll (Visual C++ runtime) if the user has Java 1.6, and a hard-coded ROP chain for HXDS.dll (Help Data Services Module) if the user has Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010.
Java 1.6 is no longer supported and does not receive security updates.
In addition to the MSVCR71.dll ASLR bypass, a variety of widely exploited code-execution vulnerabilities exist in Java 1.6.
