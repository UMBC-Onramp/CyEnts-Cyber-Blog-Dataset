The technique proved effective and was later adopted by many other ransomware operations, including REvil and DoppelPaymer, which we discuss below.
In another innovation, the cybercriminals began reporting their attacks to the media.
In late 2019, the Maze group told Bleeping Computer about its hack of the company Allied Universal , attaching a few of the stolen files as evidence.
In its e-mail conversations with the website’s editors, the group threatened to send spam from Allied Universal’s servers, and it later published the hacked company’s confidential data on the Bleeping Computer forum.
