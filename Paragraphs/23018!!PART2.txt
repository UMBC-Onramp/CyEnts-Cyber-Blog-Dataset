What is vishing?
Vishing is short for voice plus phishing (as smishing is SMS + phishing ), and, aided by the mass transition to remote work, it has turned the phone into a major weapon of fraud, to the extent that law-enforcement agencies now periodically release official announcements about the danger.
According to 2019 data from the US Federal Trade Commission, only 6% of scam calls ended in financial loss.
Nevertheless, when it happened, the damage was quite significant, with a median value of $960.
Anyone can fall for a scammer’s bait, even experts who think they’ve seen it all .
Many fraudsters are excellent at gaining the confidence of even the most vigilant target.
On the one hand, vishing is more conservative than regular phishing, because the telephone itself is an older means of communication.
On the other hand, massive data leaks in the digital age have lent voice scams new power: Never before have scammers been in possession of such volumes of information about almost everyone on the planet.
