Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed multiple instances of abuse of Microsoft Exchange Server within at least one client environment.
The observed activity included creation of web shells for persistent access, remote code execution, and reconnaissance for endpoint security solutions.
Our investigation revealed that the files created on the Exchange servers were owned by the user NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM , a privileged local account on the Windows operating system.
Furthermore, the process that created the web shell was UMWorkerProcess.exe , the process responsible for Exchange Serverâ€™s Unified Messaging Service.
In subsequent investigations, we observed malicious files created by w3wp.exe , the process responsible for the Exchange Server web front-end.
