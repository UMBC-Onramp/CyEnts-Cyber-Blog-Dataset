Currently, threat actors possess limited access to the technology required to conduct disruptive operations against financial artificial intelligence (AI) systems and the risk of this targeting type remains low.
However, there is a high risk of threat actors leveraging AI as part of disinformation campaigns to cause financial panic.
As AI financial tools become more commonplace, adversarial methods to exploit these tools will also become more available, and operations targeting the financial industry will be increasingly likely in the future.
AI Compounds Both Efficiency and Risk Financial entities increasingly rely on AI-enabled applications to streamline daily operations, assess client risk, and detect insider trading.
However, researchers have demonstrated how exploiting vulnerabilities in certain AI models can adversely affect the final performance of a system.
Cyber threat actors can potentially leverage these weaknesses for financial disruption or economic gain in the future.
