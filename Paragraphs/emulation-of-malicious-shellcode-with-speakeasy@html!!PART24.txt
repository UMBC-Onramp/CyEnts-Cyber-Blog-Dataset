The following call instruction is often used by shellcode to get its current program counter by following it with a “pop” instruction.
This allows the malware to discover where it is executing from in memory.
Since we are reasonably certain this sample is shellcode, we will invoke Speakeasy with the command line shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7:
Command line used to emulate malware sample
This will instruct Speakeasy to emulate the sample from offset zero as x86 shellcode.
