It passes the Agent Tesla payload in memory and adds a path of the target process “RegAsm.exe”.
“RegAsm.exe” is an official component of Microsoft .Net
Framework.
The attacker uses it as a target process in which to inject malware to protect itself from being detected.
A number of Windows API functions are called in the .Net module to deploy the Agent Tesla payload into the target process.
These are: CreateProcess() with CREATE_SUSPENDED flag: This creates a suspended RegAsm.exe process.
VirtualAllocEx(), NtUnmapViewOfSection(), ReadProcessMemory(), WriteProcessMemory(): These move the Agent Tesla payload to a newly-allocated memory within the suspended RegAsm.exe process.
SetThreadContext()/Wow64SetThreadContext(), GetThreadContext()/Wow64GetThreadContext(): These modify the RegAsm.exe’s registry value and points its EIP register to the entry point of the copied Agent Tesla payload.
ResumeThread(): This resumes the execution of the RegAsm.exe process from where the EIP points to.
Once completed, the Agent Tesla runs on behalf of RegAsm.exe to steal the victim’s information.
Agent Tesla Payload Agent Tesla provides many features, like Keylogger, obtaining Clipboard data, stealing browser cookies and saved software credentials, as well as capturing screenshots of the victim’s device.
