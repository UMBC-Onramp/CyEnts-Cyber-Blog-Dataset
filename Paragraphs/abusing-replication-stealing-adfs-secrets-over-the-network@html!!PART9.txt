Â In order to stay in sync with each other, the farm will have a primary node and secondary nodes.
The secondary nodes make use of a replication service to acquire configuration settings and certificates from the primary AD FS server.
To facilitate this, AD FS makes use of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).
WCF is a framework that allows developers to build service-oriented applications .
A WCF application has two components: the service that will receive and process messages, and the client that sends messages to a service and receives back responses.
The AD FS servers run a WCF service that is called the Policy Store Transfer Service internally.
To send a message to this service, the client will connect to the URL http://<adfs server name>:80/adfs/services/policystoretransfer .
Note that even though the channel is over HTTP, the actual data being exchanged is encrypted during transit.
