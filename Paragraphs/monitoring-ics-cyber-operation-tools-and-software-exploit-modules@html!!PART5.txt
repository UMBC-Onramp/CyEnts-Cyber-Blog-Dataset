Table 1: Classes of ICS-specific intrusion and attack tools While some of the tools included in our list were created as early as 2004, most of the development has taken place during the last 10 years.
The majority of the tools are also vendor agnostic, or developed to target products from some of the largest ICS original equipment manufacturers (OEM).
Siemens stands out in this area, with 60 percent of the vendor-specific tools potentially targeting its products.
Other tools we identified were developed to target products from Schneider Electric, GE, ABB, Digi International, Rockwell Automation, and Wind River Systems.
Figure 2 depicts the number of tools by class.
Of note, network discovery tools make up more than a quarter of the tools.
We also highlight that in some cases, the software exploitation tools we track host extended repositories of modules to target specific products or vulnerabilities.
