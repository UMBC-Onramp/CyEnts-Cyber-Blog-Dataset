The attacker likely utilizes the DGA subdomain to vary the DNS response to victims as a means to control the targeting of the malware.
These subdomains are concatenated with one of the following to create the hostname to resolve: .appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-west-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-east-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-east-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com Process name, service name, and driver path listings are obtained, and each value is hashed via the FNV-1a + XOR algorithm as described previously and checked against hardcoded blocklists.
Some of these hashes have been brute force reversed as part of this analysis, showing that these routines are scanning for analysis tools and antivirus engine components.
If a blocklisted process is found the Update routine exits and the sample will continue to try executing the routine until the blocklist passes.
Blocklisted services are stopped by setting their HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\<service_name>\\Start registry entries to value 4 for disabled.
Some entries in the service list if found on the system may affect the DGA algorithms behavior in terms of the values generated.
The list of stopped services is then bit-packed into the ReportWatcherPostpone key of the appSettings entry for the samplesâ€™ config file.
