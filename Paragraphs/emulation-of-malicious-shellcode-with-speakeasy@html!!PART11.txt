Malware will be able to interact with an emulated file system, network and registry.
All these emulated subsystems can be configured with a configuration file supplied to each emulation run.
Windows APIs are handled by Python API handlers.
These handlers will try to emulate expected outputs from these APIs so that malware samples will continue their expected execution path.
When defining an API handler, all that is needed is the name of the API, the number of arguments the API expects, and an optional calling convention specification.
