This program was put in the init script of the system, so it would run on boot and continually “kick the dog”, effectively disabling the hardware watchdog.
Note: no actual dogs were harmed in the research or creation of this exploit.
If anything, they were given extra treats and contributed to the coding of the watchdog patch.
Here are some very recent photos of this researcher’s dogs for proof.
Figure 20 With both the hardware and software watchdog timers pacified, we could continue to determine if our previously discovered vulnerability was exploitable.
