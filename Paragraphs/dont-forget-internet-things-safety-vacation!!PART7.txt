Ree stresses the need for IoT and smart home device manufacturers to step up their security controls and processes.
Routers, for example, should not allow routing between nodes.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation recommends that UPnP be turned off, although in some routers it may be turned on by default.
Implementing a standard security label or certification could also help from a consumer and manufacturer standpoint.
Manufacturers can validate their devices and have security controls and processes built-in before they go to customers, and customers can know which devices are more secure based on the security label.
IBM X-Force, Silicon Labs and the ioXt Alliance are presenting a virtual panel at 11 a.m. EDT on July 21, 2021, where experts will discuss three IoT- and operational technology-related security topics â€” critical infrastructure security, standardizing IoT security and the perceived privacy and security problem.
