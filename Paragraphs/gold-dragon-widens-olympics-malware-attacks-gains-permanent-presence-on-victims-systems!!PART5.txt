This sample acts as a reconnaissance tool and downloader for subsequent payloads of the malware infection and payload chain.
Apart from downloading and executing binaries from the control server, Gold Dragon generates a key to encrypt data that the implant obtains from the system.
This URL is not used for control; the encrypted data is sent to the server ink.inkboom.co.kr, which was used by previous implants as early as May 2017.
Gold Dragon contains elements, code, and similar behavior to implants Ghost419 and Brave Prince, which we have tracked since May 2017.
A DLL-based implant created on December 21 (the same day the first malicious Olympics document appeared) was downloaded by a Gold Dragon variant created December 24.
This variant was created three days before the targeted spear phishing email with the second document that was sent to 333 victim organizations.
