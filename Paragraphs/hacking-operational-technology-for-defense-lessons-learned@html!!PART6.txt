During these engagements, we emulate real actor behaviors to learn about our target and to determine the best paths for IT/OT network propagation.
For this engagement, we simulated an end-to-end OT-specific attack scenario in which we tested the security controls and response capabilities of an organization to protect smart grid meter control infrastructure from an external attacker.
Mandiant leveraged weaknesses in people, process, and technology to gain remote access from the public Internet and to achieve a set of pre-approved objectives in the OT environment.
