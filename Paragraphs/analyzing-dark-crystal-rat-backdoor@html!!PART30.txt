Figure 16 shows the results when Dark Crystal RAT is run on a system that has been configured to redirect all traffic to domalo[.]online to the proof-of-concept server we wrote.

The results when a Dark Crystal RAT instance communicates with the proof-of-concept server Other Work and Reconnaissance After reverse engineering Dark Crystal RAT, we continued reconnaissance to see what additional information we could find.
One limitation to our analysis was that we did not wish to allow the sample to communicate with the real C2, so we kept it isolated from the Internet.
To learn more about Dark Crystal RAT we tried two approaches: the first was to browse the Dark Crystal RAT website (files.dcrat[.]ru) using Tor, and the other was to take a look at YouTube videos of others’ experiments with the “real” Dark Crystal RAT server.
Dark Crystal RAT Website We found that Dark Crystal RAT has a website at files.dcrat[.]ru, shown in Figure 17.
