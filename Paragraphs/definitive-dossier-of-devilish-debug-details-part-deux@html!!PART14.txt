Term Co-Occurrence Since we had the bag-of-words vectors created for each path, we were also able to evaluate term co-occurrence across benign and malicious files.
When we evaluated the co-occurrence of pairs of terms, we found some other interesting pairings that indeed paint two very different pictures of development environments (Figure 3).
