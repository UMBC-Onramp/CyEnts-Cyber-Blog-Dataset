Both pieces of malware look for a single, highly specific process.
Both replace DLLs to achieve process manipulation.
IRONGATE detects malware detonation/observation environments, whereas Stuxnet looked for the presence of antivirus software.
IRONGATE actively records and plays back process data to hide manipulations, whereas Stuxnet did not attempt to hide its process manipulation, but suspended normal operation of the S7-315 so even if rotor speed had been displayed on the HMI, the data would have been static .
