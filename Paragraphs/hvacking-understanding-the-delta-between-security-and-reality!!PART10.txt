Although this device is not a BACnet server and functions more as a router, this test suite provided several universal test cases which gave us a great place to start.
BACnet utilizes several types of broadcast packets to communicate.
Two such broadcast packets, “Who-Is” and “I-Am” packets, are universal to all BACnet devices and Defensics provides modules to work with them.
Using the Defensics fuzzer to create mutations of these packets, we were able to observe the device encountering a failure point, producing a core dump and immediately rebooting, shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5 The test case which caused the crash was then isolated and run several more times to confirm the crash was repeatable.
We discovered during this process that it takes an additional 96 packets sent after the original malformed packet to cause the crash.
The malformed packet in the series was an “I-Am” packet, as seen below.
The full packet is not shown due to its size.
Figure 6 Examining further, we could quickly see that the fuzzer created a packet with a BACnet layer size of 8216 bytes, using “0x22”.
