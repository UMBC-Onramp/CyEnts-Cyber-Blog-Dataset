Once a Rovio account is created and personal information uploaded, the user can do little to stop this personal information sharing.
Their data might be in multiple locations: Angry Birds Cloud, Burstly (ad mediation platform), and third-party ad networks such as Jumptap and Millennial Media.
Users can avoid sharing personal data by playing Angry Birds without Rovio account, but that won’t stop the game from sharing device information.
In this blog post, we examine the personal information Angry Birds collects.
We also demonstrate the relationships between the app, the ad mediation platform, and the ad clouds — showing how the information flows among the three.
We also spell out the evidence, such as network packet capture (PCap) from FireEye Mobile Threat Prevention (MTP), to support our information flow chart.
Finally, we reveal how the multi-stage information sharing works by tracking the code paths from the reverse-engineered source code.
To investigate the mechanism and contents of the information sharing, we researched different versions of Angry Birds.
We found that multiple versions of the game can share personal information in clear text, including email, address, age, and gender.
Angry Birds’ data management service, “ad-x.co.uk,” shares information in the penultimate version of the game (V4.0.0), which was offered in the Google Play store through March 4.
