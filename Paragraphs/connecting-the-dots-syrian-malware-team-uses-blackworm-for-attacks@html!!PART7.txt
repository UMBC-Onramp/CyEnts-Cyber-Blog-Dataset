We quickly saw indicators that it was created by BlackWorm Dark Edition.

When looking at samples of Dark Edition BlackWorm being used by the Syrian Malware Team, the strings “Syrian Malware,” or “ Syrian Malware Team ” are often used in the C2 communications or within the binary strings.
Additional pivoting off of svchost.exe brought us to three additional samples apparently built with BlackWorm Dark Edition.
