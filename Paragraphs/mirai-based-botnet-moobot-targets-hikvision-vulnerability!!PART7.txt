The complete attack scenario from trying to infect Hikvision product to deploying Moobot is shown in figure 10: We also noticed that a DDoS service provider based the packet capture from our machine in Figure 11.
We tracked down a telegram channel named “tianrian,” which provides a DDoS service.
They use a specific string, “openmeokbye”, in their login interface, shown in Figure 12.
This channel was created on June 11, 2021, and started its service in August.
From the chatting channel we can see that the service is still updating.
