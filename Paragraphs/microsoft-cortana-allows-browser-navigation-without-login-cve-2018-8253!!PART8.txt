With just a little bit of tinkering we come up with the following search: insource:/\\{official (website)?\\|https?\\:\\/\\/[^}]+\\.com\\/[^}]\\}\\}\\{\\{dead link/ This is neither an exhaustive list, nor the most efficient regular expression, but it does find some candidates without triggering the Wikipedia query timeout.
The next step is to write a script to parse the output, grab a list of domains, and check whether they are actually vacant.
Many of them are still registered but do not serve any content; others are live despite the “dead link” tag.
