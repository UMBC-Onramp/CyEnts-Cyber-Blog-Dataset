The techniques we have described so far are far too complicated compared with the simplicity and effectiveness of what comes next.
You recall the use of the keyboard-timing sequence to trigger the contextual search menu from a locked screen while querying Cortana.
Any keystroke can trigger the menu from the time when Cortana begins to listen to when the answer is displayed.
Press any key at this point; we like to use the spacebar because you cannot backspace and Windows will nicely ignore or trim out the space in its text results anyways.
Invoke keyboard input too early or before Cortana is listening and you will be prompted to enter your password; invoke too late and Cortana goes back to sleep or returns normal results without a context menu.
It is not very intuitive to use the keyboard in addition of voice commands, but you can type your search the same way you do on an unlocked device, assuming that you triggered Cortana to listen.
The following screenshot demonstrates this behavior: Trigger Cortana via “Tap and Say” or “Hey Cortana” Ask a question (this is more reliable) such as “What time is it?”
