In total, this SimpleLocker variant shares four out of five major components with SlemBunk.
Figure 7 shows the major code of MessageReceiver in the previous samples to demonstrate that SimpleLocker and SlemBunk use basically the same process and logic to communicate with the CnC server.
First, class MessageReceiver registers itself to handle incoming short messages, whose arrival will trigger its method onReceive .
As seen from the figure, the main logics here are basically the same for SimpleLocker and SlemBunk.
They first read the value of a particular key from app preferences.
Note that the names for the key and shared preference are the same for these two different malware families: key is named “CHECKING_NUMBER_DONE” and preference named “AppPrefs”.
 
The following steps call method retrieveMessage to retrieve the short messages, and then forward the control flow to class SmsProcessor .
The only difference here is that SimpleLocker adds one extra method named processControlCommand to forward control flow.
