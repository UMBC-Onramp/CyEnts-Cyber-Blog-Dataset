Dynamic analysis of kernel mode malware can be more involved than with user mode samples.
In order to debug kernel malware, a proper environment needs to be created.
This usually involves setting up two separate virtual machines as debugger and debugee.
The malware can then be loaded as an on-demand kernel service where the driver can be debugged remotely with a tool such as WinDbg.
