According to an Okta’s official statement , its specialists are currently conducting an investigation and the company promises to share details as soon as the investigation is completed.
It is possible that the published screenshots are related to the January incident, when an unknown actor tried to compromise the account of a technical support engineer working for a third-party subcontractor.
Updated on March 23, 2022: LAPSUS$ has published their reply to Okta’s official statement in which they accuse the company in attempts to downplay the impact of the breach.
Who are the LAPSUS$ group and what do we know about them?
LAPSUS$ gained fame in 2020 when they compromised the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s systems.
Presumably, this is a Latin American hacker group that steals information from large companies for ransom.
If the victims refuse to pay, the hackers publish the stolen information on the Internet.
Unlike many other ransomware groups, LAPSUS$ does not encrypt the data of hacked organizations, but simply threatens to leak the data in case of non-payment of the ransom.
