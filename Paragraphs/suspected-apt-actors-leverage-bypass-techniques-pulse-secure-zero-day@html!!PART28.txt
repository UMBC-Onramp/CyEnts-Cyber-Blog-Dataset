By preserving registers and flags in this way the malicious logic is able to execute and perform its malicious logic as a passive observer if desired, only effecting the control flow in specific conditions.
This is employed in two locations, the LDAP and RADIUS authentication routines, DSAuth::LDAPAuthServer::authenticate and DSAuth::RadiusAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword respectively.
LDAP Auth Bypass In the typical execution of DSAuth::LDAPAuthServer::authenticate the legitimate application constructs the C++ object DSAuth::LDAPAuthServer::ldap then passes it to DSLdapServer::bind with the username and password for login.
This bind may fail or succeed which determines the authentication failure or success of the LDAP protocol.
The malicious logic inserted into the application redirects execution before DSLdapServer::bind just after the ldap object is constructed.
