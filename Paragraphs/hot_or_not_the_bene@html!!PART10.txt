The App Store has a strict policy prohibiting third party apps from using any private frameworks.
However, it is worth pointing out that the operating system does not differentiate Apple apps’ private framework usage and a third party app’s private framework usage.
It is simply the App Store policy that bans third party use.
With JSPatch, this restriction has no effect because the JavaScript file is not subject to the App Store’s vetting.
