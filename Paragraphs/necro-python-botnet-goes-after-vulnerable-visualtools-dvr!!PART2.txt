The script can run in both Windows and Linux environments.
The script has its own polymorphic engine to morph itself every execution which can bypass signature-based defenses.
This works by reading every string in its code and encrypting it using a hardcoded key.
Necro Python’s polymorphism, before and after Domain Generation Algorithm Necro uses DGA for both its CnC and download server.
It selects from a list of dynamic DNS services as its domain, e.g., ddns.net and prefixes that with 10-19 random characters.
E.g., ‘ 3ood3dfcqchro.ddns.net’ The domains are pseudo-randomly generated using a hardcoded seed, 0xFAFFDED00001, and a counter is added until 0xFD (253 in decimal) before the counter is reset to 0.
The seed controls the domain to be generated.
  
In effect, it can generate up to 253 unique domains.
This seed is different from the previous campaigns.
For instance, the sample used in the March attack used a different seed, 0x7774DEAD.
