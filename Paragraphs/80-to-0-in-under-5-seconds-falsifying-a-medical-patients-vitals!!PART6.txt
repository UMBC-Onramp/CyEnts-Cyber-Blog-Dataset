Many hardware simulators are on the market and vary drastically in cost.
The cheapest and easiest vital sign to simulate turned out to be a heartbeat.
For less than $100 we purchased an electrocardiogram (ECG) simulator on eBay.
The following image illustrates our test network:
In our test bed, the patient monitor (left), central monitoring station (right), and a research computer (top) were attached to a standard switch.
The research computer was configured on a monitor port of the switch to sniff the traffic between the central monitoring device and the patient monitor.
The ECG simulator was attached to the patient monitor.
Reconnaissance With the network configured, we turned to Wireshark to watch the devices in action.
