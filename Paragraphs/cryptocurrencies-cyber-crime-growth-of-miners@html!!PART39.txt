According to Sucuri researchers , cloud-based servers provide many benefits to actors looking to host their own mining applications, including: Available free or at low-cost No maintenance, just upload the crypto-miner app Harder to block as blacklisting the host address could potentially impact access to legitimate services Resilient to permanent takedown as new hosting accounts can more easily be created using disposable accounts The combination of proxies and crypto-miners hosted on actor-controlled cloud infrastructure presents a significant hurdle to security professionals, as both make cryptojacking operations more difficult to detect and take down.
Mining Victim Demographics Based on data from FireEye detection technologies, the detection of cryptocurrency miner malware has increased significantly since the beginning of 2018 (Figure 10), with the most popular mining pools being minergate and nanopool (Figure 11), and the most heavily affected country being the U.S. (Figure 12).
