A couple of older vulnerabilities were also found in the samples analyzed by FortiGuard Labs researchers, namely CVE-2017-17215 (Figure 7) targeting Huawei HG532 routers, and CVE-2016-5674 (Figure 8) targeting NUUO
NVRmini2, NVRsolo, Crystal Devices, and NETGEAR ReadyNAS Surveillance products.
While affecting a variety of products, these vulnerabilities are all similar in that they allow threat actors to inject commands to be executed after successful exploitation.
This usually involves using the wget command to download shell scripts to infect the device with Beastmode.
In addition, exploits lead to slightly different shell scripts.
Snippets of the scripts downloaded from the successful exploitation of CVE-2021-45382, CVE-2022-26186, and CVE-2022-25075, respectively are shown below (Figure 9).
As shown in the above figure, each script downloads the same file to different filenames but is executed with different parameters.
For instance, successful exploitation of CVE-2021-45382, a vulnerability involving a function named “DDNS” within D-Link router firmware, leads to the download and execution (Figure 5) of the shell script “ddns.sh”.
