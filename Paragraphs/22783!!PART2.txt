SMS + phishing.
Some classifications include phishing over messaging apps as part of smishing, but we consider that a separate category and won’t be discussing it here.
The goal, as with any other phishing attempt, is to trick recipients into divulging sensitive information, typically their online banking password or bank card information.
To do that, scammers send text messages, generally about an invented problem — a delivery issue, unpaid bill, or blocked account, for example — that the recipient has to resolve by clicking on a link.
After that, things can go one of two ways: Scenario 1 infects the victim with malware disguised as a legitimate application but whose actual purpose is to request important information; Scenario 2 takes the victim to a Web page disguised as a legitimate website but whose actual purpose is to request important information.
The choice of scenario really depends on the scammer’s comfort zone — malware or fake websites.
The victim’s outcome is the same either way.
Similar scams have resulted in the theft of thousands of dollars , euros , and pounds .
Why has SMS phishing become so popular recently, and what makes it more dangerous than typical phishing?
