Figure 1: High level software structure
Several useful plug-ins covering a wide range of common analysis are already included with FLASHMINGO, including: Find suspicious method names.
Many samples contain method names used during development, like “run_shell” or “find_virtualprotect”.
This plug-in flags samples with methods containing suspicious substrings.
Find suspicious constants.
The presence of certain constant values in the bytecode may point to malicious or suspicious code.
For example, code containing the constant value 0x5A4D may be shellcode searching for an MZ header.
