What is an ICC Color Profile?
Wikipedia provides a more-than-adequate description of ICC color profiles : \"In color management, an ICC profile is a set of data that characterizes a color input or output device, or a color space, according to standards promulgated by the International Color Consortium (ICC).
Profiles describe the color attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a mapping between the device source or target color space and a profile connection space (PCS).
This PCS is either CIELAB (L*a*b*) or CIEXYZ.
Mappings may be specified using tables, to which interpolation is applied, or through a series of parameters for transformations. ”
In simpler terms, an ICC color profile is a binary file that gets embedded into images and parsed whenever ICC supported software processes the images.
Specification The ICC specification is around 100 pages and should be easy to skim through.
Reading through specifications gives a better understanding of the file format, different types of color profiles, and math behind the color transformation.
