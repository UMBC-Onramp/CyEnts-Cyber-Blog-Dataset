Additional malware linked to the attackers RATVERMIN is a .NET backdoor that FireEye Threat Intelligence started tracking in March 2018.
It has also been reported in public reports and blog posts .
Operators Highly Aggressive, Proactive The actor is highly interactive with its tools and has responded within a couple of hours of receiving a new victim, demonstrating its ability to react quickly.
An example of this hands-on style of operation occurred during live malware analysis.
RATVERMIN operators observed that the malware was running from an unintended target at approximately 1700 GMT (12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on a weekday) and promptly executed the publicly available Hidden Tear ransomware (saved to disk as hell0.exe, MD5: 8ff9bf73e23ce2c31e65874b34c54eac).
The ransomware process was killed before it could execute successfully.
If the Hidden Tear continued execution, a file would have been left on the desktop with the following message: \"Files have been encrypted with hidden tear.
Send me some bitcoins or kebab.
And I also hate night clubs, desserts, being drunk.\" When live analysis resumed, the threat group behind the attack started deleting all the analysis tools on the machine.
