Over the past five years, ransomware has evolved from being a threat to individual computers to posing a serious danger to corporate networks.
Cybercriminals have stopped simply trying to infect as many computers as possible and are now targeting big victims instead.
Attacks on commercial organizations and government agencies require careful planning but can potentially lead to rewards in the tens of millions of dollars.
Ransomware gangs exploit companies’ financial clout, which tends to be far greater than that of ordinary users.
What’s more, many modern ransomware groups steal data prior to encryption, adding the threat of publication as further leverage.
