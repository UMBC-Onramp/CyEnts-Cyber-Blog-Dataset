In March 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense identified three zero-day vulnerabilities in SonicWall’s Email Security (ES) product that were being exploited in the wild.
These vulnerabilities were executed in conjunction to obtain administrative access and code execution on a SonicWall ES device.
The adversary leveraged these vulnerabilities, with intimate knowledge of the SonicWall application, to install a backdoor, access files and emails, and move laterally into the victim organization’s network.
The vulnerabilities are being tracked in the following CVEs: CVE-2021-20021 9.8 Unauthorized administrative account creation CVE-2021-20022 7.2 Post-authentication arbitrary file upload CVE-2021-20023 4.9 Post-authentication arbitrary file read Mandiant has been coordinating with the SonicWall Product Security and Incident Response Team (PSIRT) for the responsible disclosure of this information.
