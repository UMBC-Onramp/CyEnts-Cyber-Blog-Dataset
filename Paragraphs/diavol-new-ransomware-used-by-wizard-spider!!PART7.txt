 Register with the C&C server and update configuration:
The REGISTER payload uses the WinINet API to send a request to a server and returns the response status code.
Diavol issues the C&C server a POST request to the hxxp://<server_address>/BnpOnspQwtjCA/register URL with the following headers: User-Agent: \"Agent\" Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
The body of the request is : cid=<unique_victim_id>&group=<group_id_from_config>ip_local1=111.111.111.111&ip_local2=222.222.222.222&ip_external=2.16.7.12
If the server returns status success, the ransomware will attempt to get an updated configuration from the C&C server.
