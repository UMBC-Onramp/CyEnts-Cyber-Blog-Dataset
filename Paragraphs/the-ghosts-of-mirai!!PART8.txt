SYLVEON
Coming Out of Retirement?
What surprised us more was the appearance of the SYLVEON variant on the table.
In mid-2019 there was a 14-year old European IoT malware author that went by the name of “Light The Sylveon” and “Light The Leafeon”.
When we took quick look at the decrypted strings of one of the binaries we captured, the word “Leafeon” was found, creating speculation that this might be the author’s comeback.
“Light the Sylveon” co-created the destructive SILEX IoT malware, whose goal was to render vulnerable devices inoperable by running destructive commands–very similar to BrickerBot .
From the malware authors’ perspective, based on a message embedded in the malware’s binary, this was to “prevent skids to flex their skidded botnet.”
