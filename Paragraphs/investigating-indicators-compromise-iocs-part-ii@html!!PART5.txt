John needs additional information before he can start to act.
He knows two things about the attacker that might be able to help him out:
The attacker is using a domain service account to perform network logons.
The attacker has been using WCE to obtain credentials and the \"WCE SERVICE\" service appears in event logs.
John turns to his security event and incident management (SEIM) system, which aggregates logs from his domain controllers, enterprise antivirus and intrusion detection systems.
A search of type 3 network logons using the \"backupDaily\" domain account turns up 23 different systems accessed using that account.
John runs another query for the \"WCE SERVICE\" and sees that logs from 3 domain controllers contain that service event.
John needs to look for IOCs across all Acme machines in a short period of time.
