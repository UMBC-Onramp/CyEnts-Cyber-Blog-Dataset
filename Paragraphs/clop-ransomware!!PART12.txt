After this, it will make 2 threads, one of them to search for processes and the another one to crypt files in the network shares that it has access to.
The first thread enumerates all processes of the system and creates the name of the process in upper case and calculates a hash with the name and compares it with a big list of hashes.
This hash algorithm is a custom algorithm.
It is typical in malware that tries to hide what processes they are looking for.
If it finds one of them it will terminate it with “TerminateProcess” function after opening with the rights to make this action with “OpenProcess” function.
The malware contains 61 hard-coded hashes of programs such as “STEAM.EXE”, database programs, office programs and others.
Below, the first 38 hashes with the associated process names.
These 38 processes are the most usual processes to close as we have observed with other ransomwares families such as GandCrab, Cerber, etc.
