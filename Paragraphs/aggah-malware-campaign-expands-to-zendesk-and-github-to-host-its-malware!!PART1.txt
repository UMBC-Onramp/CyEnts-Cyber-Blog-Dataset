Juniper Threat Labs has detected a new development in the Aggah malware campaign.
Previously, Aggah was known to be using legitimate infrastructures like BlogSpot, WordPress and Pastebin to host its malware.
Recently, we discovered an ongoing campaign where Aggah threat actors host their malware using Zendesk attachments and GitHub.
