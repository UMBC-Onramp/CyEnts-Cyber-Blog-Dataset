To do this, we collected severe vulnerabilities that have known exploits by their presence in the following data sources: Symantec Antivirus signatures Symantec Intrusion Prevention System signatures ExploitDB catalog The dataset for exploit forecasting was comprised of 377,468 tweets gathered from January 2016 to November 2017.
Of the 1,409 CVEs used in our forecasting evaluation, 134 publicly weaponized vulnerabilities were found across all three data sources.
Using CVEs from the aforementioned sources as ground truth, we find our CVE classification model is more predictive of detecting operationalized exploits from the vulnerabilities than CVSS.
Table 3 shows precision scores illustrating seven of the top ten most severe CVEs and 21 of the top 100 vulnerabilities were found to have been exploited in the wild.
Compare that to one of the top ten and 16 of the top 100 from using the CVSS score itself.
The recall scores show the percentage of our 134 weaponized vulnerabilities found in our K examples.
