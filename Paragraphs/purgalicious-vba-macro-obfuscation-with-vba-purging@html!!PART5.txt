VBA purging modifies the module streams in the opposite way.
Instead\nof changing the CompressedSourceCode , VBA\npurging completely removes the PerformanceCache data from the module stream and\nthe _VBA_PROJECT stream , changes the value\nof the MODULEOFFSET to 0, and removes all\nSRP streams (this is necessary because the _VBA_PROJECT and SRP streams contain version-dependent PerformanceCache data that will result in a\nruntime error when there is no PerformanceCache in the module stream).
Â This\nremoves strings usually found in PerformanceCache that many AV engines and YARA\nrules depend on for detection.
Once removed, attackers are able to use\nmore standard methodologies and execute suspicious functions (i.e. CreateObject ) without being detected.
