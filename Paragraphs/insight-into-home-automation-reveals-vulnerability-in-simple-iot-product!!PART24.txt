We still face a major challenge: Only addresses comprising entirely ASCII characters can pass through the XML filter.
This drastically limits the potential for finding usable gadgets.
We used IDA to see where libc and system are loaded into memory, and found two implementations: in libuClibc-0.9.33.2.so at address 0x2B0C0FD4; and in libpthread-0.9.33.2.so at address 0x2AD104F4.
However, neither of these addresses meet the requirements to pass through the XML filter.
Thus even if we could create an ROP chain, we would not be able to send just the address for system in the packet.
Addresses with bad characters are not a new problem for exploit development.
One of the most common bypasses is to use addition or subtraction ROP gadgets to create the required address in a register and call that register.
