We observed that Sodinokibi, like GandCrab and Anatova, are blacklisting the regular Syrian language and the Syrian language in Arabic too.
If the system contains one of these languages, it will exit without performing any action.
If a different language is detected, it will continue in the normal flow.
This is interesting and may hint to an affiliate being involved who has mastery of either one of the languages.
