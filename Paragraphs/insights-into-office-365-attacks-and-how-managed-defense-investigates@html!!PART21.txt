NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Analyze Compromised Users Logs
After we’ve finished scoping the tenant, we’ll turn our attention to the individual users believed to be involved in the compromise.
We’ll acquire all relevant O365 logs for the identified compromised user(s) - this includes the user's UAL, Mailbox Audit Log (MAL), and Admin audit log (if the user is an administrator).
We’ll review these logs for anomalous account activity and assemble a list of attacker IP addresses and User-Agents strings.
We’ll use this list to further scope the tenant.
O365 investigations rely heavily on anomaly detection.
Many times, the BEC actor may even be active at the same time as the user.
In order to accurately differentiate between legitimate user activity and attacker activity within a compromised account, it's recommended to pull back as much data as possible to use as a reference for legitimate activity.
