In total, there are 49 C2 servers (IP address and port) hardcoded and encrypted within this variant.
Please refer to the “C2 Server List” under the “IOCs” section for all the IP addresses and ports.
The C2 server detects the submitted data to determine next steps, including replying with Emotet modules and commands for further actions.
The replied data is encrypted binary data in the HTTP response body.
In Figure 5.3, below, the marked box is an example of the data just after decryption.
The decrypted data is 60H long and contains both verification data and control data.
0x40 at the beginning is the size of the verification data, the signature data (31 1B … 3C 6D), which is a signed hash of the control data.
