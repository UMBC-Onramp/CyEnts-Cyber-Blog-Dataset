The only one remaining that was substantially modified is NameTbl::InvokeInternal.
Diaphora provides us with a diff of the assembly code of the two versions of the function.
In this instance, it is easier to compare the functions side by side in Ida Pro to see what has changed.
A quick glance toward the end of the function shows the introduction of two calls to GCRoot::~GCRoot (the destructor of the object GCRoot).
Looking at the implementation of ~GCRoot, we see it is the same code as that inlined in that function created by the compiler in the older version of the DLL.
In the newer version of the DLL, this function is called twice; while in the unpatched version, the code was called only once (inlined by the compiler, hence the absence of a function call).
In C++ parlance, ~GCRoot is the destructor of GCRoot, so we may want to find the constructor of GCRoot.
