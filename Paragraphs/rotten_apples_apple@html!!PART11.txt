Table 1: Domain registration information Looking closer at our malicious domain detection system, we observed that the system had been seeing similar domains at an increasing frequency.
Analyzing the registration information, we found some interesting patterns.
Since January 2016 to the time of writing, the system marked around 240 unique domains that have something to do with Apple ID, iCloud or iTunes.
From these 240 domains , we identified 154 unique email registrants with 64 unique emails pointing to qq[.]com, 36 unique Gmail email accounts, and 18 unique email addresses each belonging to 163[.]com and 126[.]com, and a couple more registered with 139[.]com.
