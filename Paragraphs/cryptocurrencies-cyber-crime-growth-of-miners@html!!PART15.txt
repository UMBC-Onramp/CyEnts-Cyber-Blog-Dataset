In extreme cases, CPU overload may even cause the operating system to crash.
Infected machines may also attempt to infect neighboring machines and therefore generate large amounts of traffic that can overload victims' computer networks.
In the case of operational technology (OT) networks, the consequences could be severe.
Supervisory control and data acquisition/industrial control systems (SCADA/ICS) environments predominately rely on decades-old hardware and low-bandwidth networks, therefore even a slight increase in CPU load or the network could leave industrial infrastructures unresponsive, impeding operators from interacting with the controlled process in real-time.
The electricity cost, measured in kilowatt hour (kWh), is dependent upon several factors: how often the malicious miner software is configured to run, how many threads it's configured to use while running, and the number of machines mining on the victim's network.
The cost per kWh is also highly variable and depends on geolocation.
For example, security researchers who ran Coinhive on a machine for 24 hours found that the electrical consumption was 1.212kWh.
