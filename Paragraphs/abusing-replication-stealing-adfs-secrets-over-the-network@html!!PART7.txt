Golden SAML Golden SAML was coined in 2017 by CyberArk to describe the technique of forging SAML tokens to access SPs given a valid Token Signing Certificate.
At TROOPERS 19 , I detailed how a threat actor could extract the Token Signing Certificate from an AD FS server, as well as some mitigation strategies for defenders.
In a default AD FS configuration, the Token Signing Certificate is stored within a Windows Internal Database (WID) instance that is running on the AD FS server.
WID is more or less MS SQL Express, except the database can only be accessed locally over a special named pipe connection.
In AD FS, the database is further locked down to only the AD FS service account.
The Token Signing Certificate is stored in an encrypted state in the IdentityServerPolicy.
ServiceStateSummary table.
Figure 2 contains a single row with a column that stores all the settings that AD FS will need on service start as an XML document.
<SigningToken> <IsChainIncluded>false</IsChainIncluded> <IsChainIncludedSpecified>false</IsChainIncludedSpecified> <
