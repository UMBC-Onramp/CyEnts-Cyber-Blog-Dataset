On vulnerable machines it is possible to rename it to a domain controller account name, which is a key step in the exploitation chain.
Security Principal Name A security principal name (SPN) is the name that identifies an authenticated entity—for example, machinename$@domainname.
SPN s are used by Kerberos as part of the authentication procedures of various entities.
It is basically a unique identifier of a service instance and used by Kerberos authentication to associate a service instance with a service logon account.
This may pose a problem when trying to rename a computer account to a domain controller account because changing the samAccountName attribute will trigger a respective change to the SPN of the account.
The attempt to change it will fail because an SPN with this name already exists.
To overcome this, it is possible to clear the machine “servicePrincipalName” attribute.
