Real Quick
In case you’re thrown by that fantastic title, our lawyers made us change the name of this project so we wouldn’t get sued.
SCANdalous—a.k.a.
Scannah Montana a.k.a.
Scanny McScanface a.k.a.
“Scan I Kick It?
(Yes You Scan)”—had another name before today that, for legal reasons, we’re keeping to ourselves.
A special thanks to our legal team who is always looking out for us, this blog post would be a lot less fun without them.
Strap in folks.
