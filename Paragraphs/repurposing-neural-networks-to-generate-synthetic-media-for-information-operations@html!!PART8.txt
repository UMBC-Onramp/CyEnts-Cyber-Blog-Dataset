The pre-trained models covered here were each released just within\nthe last year, so the demonstrations in the next section should be\nseen through the lens of the present moment in time.
However, open\nsource releases are accelerating, and the bar for generating credible\nsynthetic content will likely lower even further in the years to come.
See No Evil As a first proof of concept, weâ€™ll demonstrate how StyleGAN2 can be\nfine-tuned in order to generate custom portraits to impersonate a\ntarget individual.
StyleGAN2, like its\npredecessor StyleGAN, is architected as a generative adversarial\nneural network (or GAN) .
