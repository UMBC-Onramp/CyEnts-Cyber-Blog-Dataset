The address used is: hXXp://www[.]bitly[.]com/awnycnxbcxncbrpopor/ Phase 2 The call out to Bitly will be redirected to a location on MediaFire – a file hosting site (hXXp://download2261[.]mediafire[.]com/6lcqxbws032g/wctsdmx4dsh95xs/19.htm).

If we arrange the file into a more readable format, we get a better sense of what it’s trying to do.
As seen in Figure 6 , the file attempts to taskkill several applications and services followed by adding a scheduled task into the Windows Task scheduler.
The script then attempts to download and execute another file from MediaFire - hXXp://www[.]mediafire[.]com/file/otza6n31talvvle/19.dll.
