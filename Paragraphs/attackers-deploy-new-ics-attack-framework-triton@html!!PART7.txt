For at least the past decade, there has been a trend towards integrating DCS and SIS designs for various reasons including lower cost, ease of use, and benefits achieved from exchanging information between the DCS and SIS.
We believe TRITON acutely demonstrates the risk associated with integrated designs that allow bi-directional communication between DCS and SIS network hosts.
Safety Instrumented Systems Threat Model and Attack Scenarios Figure 2: Temporal Relationship Between Cyber Security and Safety The attack lifecycle for disruptive attacks against ICS is similar to other types of cyber attacks, with a few key distinctions.
First, the attackerâ€™s mission is to disrupt an operational process rather than steal data.
Second, the attacker must have performed OT reconnaissance and have sufficient specialized engineering knowledge to understand the industrial process being controlled and successfully manipulate it.
Figure 2 represents the relationship between cyber security and safety controls in a process control environment.
