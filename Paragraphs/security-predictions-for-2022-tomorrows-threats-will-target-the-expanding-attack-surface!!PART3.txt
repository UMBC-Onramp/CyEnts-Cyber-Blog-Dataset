Linux still runs the back-end systems of most networks and until recently, it has largely been ignored by the hacker community.
But we have already begun to see new Linux-based attacks like Vermilion Strike, which is a malicious implementation of the Beacon feature of Cobalt Strike that can target Linux systems with remote access capabilities without being detected.
Similarly, Microsoft is actively integrating WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) into Windows 11.
WSL is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows.
We have already seen malicious test files in the wild targeting WSL.
These files act as loaders, many with malicious payloads.
They just lack the ability to inject those payloads into the WSL system.
And we are also seeing more botnet malware being written for Linux platforms.
