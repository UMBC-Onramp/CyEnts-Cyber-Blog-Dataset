LEMONSTICK is a Linux executable command line utility with backdoor capabilities.
The backdoor can execute files, transfer files, and tunnel connections.
LEMONSTICK can be started in two different ways: passing the `-c` command line argument (with an optional file) and setting the ‘OCB’ environment variable.
When started with the `-c` command line argument, LEMONSTICK spawns an interactive shell.
When started in OCB mode, LEMONSTICK expects to read from STDIN.
The STDIN data is expected to be encrypted with the blowfish algorithm.
After decrypting, it dispatches commands based on the name—for example: ‘executes terminal command’, ‘connect to remote system’, ‘send & retrieve file’, ‘create socket connection’.
LOGBLEACH is an ELF utility that has a primary functionality of deleting log entries from a specified log file(s) based on a filter provided via command line.
