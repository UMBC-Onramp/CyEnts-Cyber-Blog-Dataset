This business scheme is often referred to a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS).
Affiliates are given a new build of Kraken every 15 days to keep the payload fully undetectable from antimalware products.
According to ThisWasKraken, when a victim asks for a free decryption test, the affiliate member should send one of the victimâ€™s files with its associated unique key to the Kraken Cryptor ransomware support service.
The service will decrypt the file and resend it to the affiliate member to forward the victim.
After the victim pays the full ransom, the affiliate member sends a percentage of the received payment to the RaaS developers to get a decryptor key, which is forwarded to the victim.
This system ensures the affiliate pays a percentage to the affiliate program and does not simply pocket the full amount.
