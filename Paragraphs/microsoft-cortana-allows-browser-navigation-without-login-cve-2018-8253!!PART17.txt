We next investigated which browser is being used?
Is it a Cortana custom browser?
Is it a sandboxed Microsoft Edge?
It is actually a customized Internet Explorer 11 restricted engine running in the context of AuthHost.exe.
(We will publish another analysis on this limited “browser” because its properties and lack of security mechanisms could become handy for red teams.)
This is the Internet Explorer engine and not the full browser, though both JavaScript and cookies are enabled.
Worse, this incarnation shares the autocomplete and credentials saved in the context of the current user’s Internet Explorer session.
