The NtWriteFile export may be used to easily write to stdout or a file, but we must re-enter the 64-bit execution mode and do the inverse argument mapping as before.
This logging routine can be called from within the 32-bit callbacks and is shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22.
Figure 21: call_function64 invokes shellcode to call the 64bit WriteFile from with the 32bit callback Figure 22: 32bit callbacks must log via routines that only call non-reentrant WOW64 APIs
