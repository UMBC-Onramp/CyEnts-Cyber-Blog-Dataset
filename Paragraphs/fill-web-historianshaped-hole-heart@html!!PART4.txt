One difference you may notice is the absence of an option to specify the browser(s)
you would like to target.
You can now find that option by selecting Show Advanced Parameters from the upper right corner of the window.
Once advanced parameters are enabled, simply type the name of any browser(s)
you would like to target, each on its own separate line in the Target Browser field.
