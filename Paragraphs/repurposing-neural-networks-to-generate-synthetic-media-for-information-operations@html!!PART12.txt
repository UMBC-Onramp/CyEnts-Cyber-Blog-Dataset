Using Mr. Hanks again as an example,\nwe demonstrate the result of this process on a few pieces of input\ntext that were chosen by us to resemble cell-phone quality commentary\nthat is thematically representative of the types of narratives we see\npushed in IO campaigns.
While the specific examples here are somewhat\nrobotic and show signs of inauthenticity, the timbre of the voice is\n(in our subjective view) similar to that of Mr. Hanks.
