Therefore, if a function in the main Delta binary shares a name and signature with one defined in an attacker-generated library that is loaded first, the attacker-defined function will be executed in its place.
As the attacker has a root shell on the device, it is possible for them to modify the init scripts to populate the LD_PRELOAD variable with a path to an attacker-generated library before starting the Delta software upon boot, essentially installing malware that executes upon reboot.
Using the cross-compile toolchain created in the early stages of the project, it was simple to test this theory with the “library” shown in Figure 30.
Figure 30 The code above doesn’t do anything meaningful, but it does confirm if hooking this method will work as expected.
  
We first defined a function pointer using the same function prototype we saw in IDA for canioWriteOutput.
