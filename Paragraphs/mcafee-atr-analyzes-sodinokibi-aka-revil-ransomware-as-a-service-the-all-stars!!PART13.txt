Where are the All-Stars?
Top Affiliates Missing in 5.2 At the time we were not realizing it fully but, looking back at the overview, it stands out that none of the top affiliates/ID numbers where present in the final version 5.2 of GandCrab which was released in February.
We believe that this was an early indicator that the end of GandCrab was imminent.
This discovery might indicate that some kind of event had taken place that resulted in the most active affiliates not being present.
The cause could have been internal or external.
But what puzzles us is why would a high performing affiliate leave?
Maybe we will never hear the exact reason.
Perhaps it is quite similar to why people leave regular jobsâ€¦ feeling unhappy, a dispute or leaving for a better offer.
