Research Saturday “Hackable?”
By McAfee Security researcher Douglas McKee prepares his demo of hacking a medical patient’s vitals.
Onsite visitors will have the opportunity to solve a unique, multipart cryptographic challenge, painted on our custom mural wall in the lab.
Those who are successful will receive an Advanced Threat Research team challenge coin!
We will soon have an official video from the lab’s opening event online.
