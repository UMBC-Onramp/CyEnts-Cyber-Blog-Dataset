The 13th release came out just recently.
Each of these expansions adds new elements to the virtual world.
It may be buildings (you can now build an airport of your own design), natural phenomena, development scenarios (“green” city), and so on.
Unofficial modifications expand the game even more.
In fact, any player who seriously enjoys Cities: Skylines , will eventually start experimenting with mods.
The game was originally designed to make it easy for users to develop and share modifications.
Anybody can upload them to the public Steam Workshop directory .
