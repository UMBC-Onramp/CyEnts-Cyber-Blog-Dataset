The random model would predicted 59, while our model predicted 78 of the top 100 and all ten of the most severe vulnerabilities.
Table 2:
Comparison of random simulated predictions, a model based just on quantitative features like “likes”, and the results of our model Exploit Forecasting Results
We also measured the practical ability of our model to identify the exploitability of a CVE in the wild, since this is one of the motivating factors for tracking.
