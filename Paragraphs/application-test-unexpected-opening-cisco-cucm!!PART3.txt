The Findings During the pen test, we first tried to use the least possible privilege to pinpoint the vulnerabilities that the least trusted users can reach.
Then, we created a replica of the appliance in a lab environment.
Using several reverse engineering techniques, we extracted the source code of the web application used to manage the appliance.
Through both dynamic testing and analysis of the source code, we found the following vulnerabilities: 3 x Structured Query Language (SQL) injection (CVE-2021-1355, CVE-2021-1364, CVE-2021-1282) SQL injection leads to arbitrary code execution (CVE-2021-1363, CVE-2021-1365)
Path traversal (CVE-2021-1357)
Cross-site scripting (CVE-2021-1407, CVE-2021-1408)
The main objective was to find vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to elevate their privilege on the appliance.
