(One notable exception: you cannot bypass HTTPS encryption by exploiting FragAttacks.)
Worse, threat actors can use FragAttacks to mount attacks against devices connected to the Wi-Fi network, including Internet ofÂ Things (IoT) devices.
Those vulnerabilities open up the same access to poorly secured devices attackers would have if they logged on to the network.
Some of these vulnerabilities can be used to inject malicious, unencrypted Wi-Fi frames that look like handshake messages.
