In addition to the hook, JITM also includes a .NET loader.
This loader first loads the native hook DLL ( jitmhook.dll ) and installs the hook.
The loader then loads the MassLogger payload and executes its entry point.
This causes MassLoggerâ€™s module initialization code to execute and install its own hook, but hooking jitmhook.dll code instead of the original compileMethod() .
