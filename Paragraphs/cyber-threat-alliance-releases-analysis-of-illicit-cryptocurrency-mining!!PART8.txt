In late 2017, misconfigured devices using FTP led to hundreds of thousands of Monero miners on consumer-grade devices.
Bad actors can and have used these same flaws for additional attacks against the systems.
Physical damage is also a concern.
The CPU-intensive operation of mining will produce excess heat and power consumption.
For small devices the immediate concern is battery life.
However, for large systems, especially data centers, the activity can increase the failure rate of components; this can have a major effect on the system.
Ultimately this may lead to costly repairs or increased hardware requirements to support the expanded load.
Organizations may also see a hit to business operations.
Mass-computing projects present a similar concern, albeit for more altruistic purposes.
Folding@Home , a medical research project aimed at understanding proteins, can be installed to use computer resources to help the research.
