Mandiant Intelligence confirmed that North Korea’s APT37 exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day as early as September 3, 2017.
Within 8 days of disclosure, we observed Russia’s APT28 also leverage this vulnerability, with financially motivated attackers and North Korea’s TEMP.Hermit also using within approximately a month of disclosure.
Availability of PoC or Exploit Code The availability of POC or exploit code on its own does not always increase the probability or speed of exploitation.
However, we believe that POC code likely hastens exploitation attempts for vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction.
For vulnerabilities that have already been exploited, the subsequent introduction of publicly available exploit or POC code indicates malicious actor interest and makes exploitation accessible to a wider range of attackers.
