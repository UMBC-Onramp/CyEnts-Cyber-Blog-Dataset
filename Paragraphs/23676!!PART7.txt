That kind of proxyware can take down an organization’s entire IT infrastructure.
It could also lead to ransomware encrypting data, ransom demands, and more.
In sum, proxyware is a grab bag of dangers for a business.
Covert installation of proxyware Most scenarios resemble the above: unintended consequences of purposeful (if sometimes unauthorized) installations.
The converse sometimes happens as well, with an employee catching actual malware on a shady site, and that malware installing a modified proxyware client on the computer.
That’s nothing but trouble: slowed computers, less network bandwidth, and, potentially, data theft.
Recommendations for businesses Your best way to combat criminal exploitation through proxyware is to install a reliable antivirus solution on every computer that has Internet access.
Not only will that protect your company from the harmful effects of proxyware, but if said proxyware includes, or is included with, other malware, you’ll still be covered.
