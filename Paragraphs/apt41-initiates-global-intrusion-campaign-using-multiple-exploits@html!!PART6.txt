Example APT41 HTTP traffic exploiting CVE-2019-19781 Citrix released a mitigation for CVE-2019-19781 on December 17, 2019, and as of January 24, 2020, released permanent fixes for all supported versions of Citrix ADC, Gateway, and SD-WAN WANOP.
Cisco Router Exploitation On February 21, 2020, APT41 successfully exploited a Cisco RV320 router at a telecommunications organization and downloaded a 32-bit ELF binary payload compiled for a 64-bit MIPS processor named ‘fuc’ (MD5: 155e98e5ca8d662fad7dc84187340cbc).
It is unknown what specific exploit was used, but there is a Metasploit module that combines two CVE’s ( CVE-2019-1653 and CVE-2019-1652 ) to enable remote code execution on Cisco RV320 and RV325 small business routers and uses wget to download the specified payload.
