What versions of Log4j are vulnerable?
CVE-2021-44228 :
All Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 through 2.12.1, and 2.13.0 through 2.14.1 (also includes 2.15.0-rc1) are vulnerable.
CVE-2021-45046 : Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 CVE-2021-45105 : Log4j versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.16.0 Have these vulnerabilities been patched?
Yes, Java 8 or later users are advised to update to Log4j 2.17.0 as soon as possible.
However, due to the incompleteness of the fix offered in 2.15.0, Apache released subsequent Log4j versions 2.16.0, 2.17.0 which users are strongly advised to apply.
