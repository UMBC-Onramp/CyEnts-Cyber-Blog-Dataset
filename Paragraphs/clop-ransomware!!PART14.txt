For each network share that the malware discovers, it will prepare to enumerate more shares and crypt files.
For each folder discovered, it will enter it and search for more subfolders and files.
The first step is to check the name of the folder/file found against a hardcoded list of hashes with the same algorithm used to detect the processes to close.
Below are the results of 12 of the 27 hashes with the correct names: If it passes, it will check that the file is not a folder, and in this case compare the name with a list of hardcoded names and extensions that are in plain text rather than in hash format: ClopReadMe.txt ntldr NTDLR boot.ini BOOT.INI ntuser.ini NTUSER.INI AUTOEXEC.BAT autoexec.bat .Clop NTDETECT.COM ntdetect.com .dll
