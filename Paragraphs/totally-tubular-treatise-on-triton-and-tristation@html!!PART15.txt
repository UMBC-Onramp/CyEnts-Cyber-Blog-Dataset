It is a library that helps support the communications for a Triconex controller.
If you've pored over TRITON as much as we have, the moment you look at strings you can see the obvious overlaps between the legitimate DLL and TRITON's own TS_cnames.pyc.
Figure 8:
Strings excerpt from tr1com40.DLL Each of the execution command \"error codes\" from TS_cnames.pyc are in the strings of tr1com40.DLL (Figure 8).
We see \"An MP has re-educated\" and \"Invalid Tristation I command\".
Even misspelled command strings verbatim such as \"Non-existant data item\" and \"Alocate network accepted\".
We also see many of the same unknown values.
What is obvious from this discovery is that some of the strings in TRITON are likely based on code used in communications libraries for Trident and Tricon controllers.
In our brief survey of the legitimate Triconex Corporation binaries, we observed a few samples with related string tables.
