They should also have tools in place designed to protect, detect, and respond to threats targeting these devices.
Similarly, organizations need to take a security-first approach when adopting new technologies, whether upgrading your Windows-based systems or adding satellite-based connectivity, to ensure that protections are in place before adding them to your network.
