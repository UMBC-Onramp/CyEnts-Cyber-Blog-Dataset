One of the new UNC groups created in October 2020 was given the designation UNC2374.
UNC2374 began as its own distinct cluster where BEACON, WINDARC, and SYSTEMBC were observed during an incident at a Managed Defense customer.
Initial similarities in tooling did not constitute a strong enough link to merge UNC2374 with UNC2198 yet.
Two and a half months following the creation of UNC2374, we amassed enough data points to merge UNC2374 into UNC2198.
Some of the data points used in merging UNC2374 into UNC2198 include: UNC2198 and UNC2374 Cobalt Strike Team Servers used self-signed certificates with the following subject on TCP port 25055: C = US, ST = CA, L = California, O = Oracle Inc, OU =
Virtual Services, CN = oracle.com UNC2198 and UNC2374 deployed WINDARC malware to identical file paths: %APPDATA%\\teamviewers\\msi.dll
The same code signing certificate used to sign an UNC2198 BEACON loader was used to sign two UNC2374 SYSTEMBC tunneler payloads.
UNC2374 and UNC2198 BEACON C2 servers were accessed by the same victim system within a 10-minute time window during intrusion operations.
The other UNC group created in October 2020 was given the designation UNC2414.
Three separate intrusions were attributed to UNC2414, and as the cluster grew, we surfaced similarities between UNC2414 and UNC2198.
A subset of the data points used to merge UNC2414 into UNC2198 include: UNC2198 and UNC2414 BEACON servers used self-signed certificates using the following subject on TCP port 25055: C = US, ST = CA, L = California, O = Oracle Inc, OU =
