By Christiaan Beek on Mar 11, 2018 The nonperishable nature of medical data makes an irresistible target for cybercriminals.
The art of hacking requires significant time and effort, encouraging experienced cybercriminals to plot their attacks based on the return they will see from their investment.
Those who have successfully gained access to medical data have been well rewarded for their efforts.
One seller stated in an interview that “someone wanted to buy all the … records specifically,” claiming that the effort had netted US$100,000.
While at a doctor’s appointment with my wife watching a beautiful 4D ultrasound of our unborn child, I noticed the words “saving data to image” flash on the screen.
Although this phrase would not catch the attention of most people, given my research on how cybercriminals are targeting the health care industry , I quickly began to wonder why an ultrasound of our child would not instead save to a file.
