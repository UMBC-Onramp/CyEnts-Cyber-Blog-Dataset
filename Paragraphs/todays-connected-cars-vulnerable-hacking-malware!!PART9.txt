In 2016, McAfee security researchers demonstrated a ransomware proof of concept that blocked the use of the car until the ransom was paid.
A proof-of-concept IVI ransomware attack on a vehicle.
The ransomware was installed via an over-the-air system that allowed the connection of external equipment.
Third-Party Apps Many modern cars allow third parties to create applications to further connected services.
For example, it is possible to unlock or lock the door from your smartphone using an app.
Although these apps can be very convenient, they effectively open these services to anyone and can become a new attack vector.
It is easier to hack a smartphone app than a carâ€™s ECU because the former is more affordable and offers many more resources.
Car apps are also vulnerable because some third parties employ weak security practices and credentials are sometimes stored in clear text.
