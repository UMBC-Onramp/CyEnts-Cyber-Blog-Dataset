Suspicion is raised only by taking a closer look at the address the e-mail came from.

The first sign it’s a fake is the typo in the company name in the e-mail address (metamasks instead of metamask).
Another red flag is the domain, (the part of the address after the @ symbol).
Respectable companies usually use their name as the domain, for example, account-security-noreply@microsoft.com.
In this case, however, the domain has no relation at all to MetaMask.
Lastly, .de indicates that the address is registered in Germany, which is also strange, since MetaMask is an American company.
