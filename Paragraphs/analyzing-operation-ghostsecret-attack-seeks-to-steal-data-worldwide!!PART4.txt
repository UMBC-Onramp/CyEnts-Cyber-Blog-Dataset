Analysis The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team discovered a previously unknown data-gathering implant that surfaced in mid-February 2018.
This implant appears to be a derivative of implants authored before by Hidden Cobra and contains functionality similar to that of Bankshot, with code overlaps from other Hidden Cobra implants.
However, the variant is not based on Bankshot.
Our analysis of the portable executableâ€™s rich-header data reveals that the two implants were compiled in different development environments.
(The PE rich header is an undocumented part of a Windows executable that reveals unique information to identify the Microsoft compiler and linker used to create the program.
It is helpful for identifying similarities between malware variants to establish common development environments.)
Our analysis of the code and PE rich header indicates that Bankshot, Proxysvc, and the Destover-like implant are distinct families, but also contain overlapping code and functionality with current tools of Hidden Cobra.
PE rich header data from the 2018 Bankshot implant.
PE rich header data from the new February 2018 implant.
PE rich header data from Proxysvc.dll.
When we compared the PE rich header data of the new February 2018 implant with a variant of Backdoor.
Escad (Destover) from 2014 shortly before the Sony Pictures attack, we found the signatures to be identical.
The Destover-like variant is 83% similar in code to a 2015 variant and contains the same rich PE header signature as the Backdoor.
