It then tries to encrypt as many files as it can, giving encrypted files an extension name similar to the random string in the ransom note file name.
It also uses the Windows Defender executable, MsMpEng.exe, to avoid detection, but it side-loads the malicious library, “mpsvc.dll”, to employ its payload.
The future variant of this ransomware might use a different valid executable, but so far, we have only observed MsMpEng.exe.
There are different variants of this ransomware where the strings, including the ransom note and C&Cs, are encrypted using randomized keys within its code.
