The convergence of the losses to low values, together with a high Area Under the ROC Curve (i.e. AUC), illustrates that transfer learning allowed this model to accurately detect social media posts associated with IRA information operations activity versus benign ones.
Taken together, these metrics indicate that the fine-tuned classifier should generalize well to newly ingested social media posts, providing analysts a capability they can use to separate signal from noise.
