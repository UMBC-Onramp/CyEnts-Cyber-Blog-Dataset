There is already considerable activity in the security research community on these techniques.
Sample code for two of the three variants was posted by the Graz University (in an appendix of the Spectre paper).
Erik Bosman has also tweeted that he has built an exploit , though this code is not yet public.
An earlier example of side-channel exploitation based upon memory caches was posted to GitHub in 2016 by one Meltdown-Spectre researcher Daniel Gruss.
Despite these details, as of this writing no known exploits have yet been seen in the wild.
McAfee ATR will continue to monitor researchers’ and attackers’ interest in these techniques and provide updates accordingly.
