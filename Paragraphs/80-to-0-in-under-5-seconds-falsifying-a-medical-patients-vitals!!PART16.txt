The central monitor responds to the patient monitor on port 2000 with a new source port.
Immediately following, we see the data packets being sent to the new source port, 3627, named in the previous exchange.
This exam provides insight into why the replay attack did not work.
The central station defines for each connection which ports will be open for the incoming data; we need to consider this when attempting a replay attack.
Modifying our previous Scapy scripts to account for the handshake, we retested the replay attack.
With the new handshake code in place, the test still failed.
Taking another look at the “SYN,ACK” packets provides a potential reason for the failure.
At offset 0x3D is a counter that needs to be incremented each time one of these packets is sent.
In this case the patient monitor’s source IP address is embedded in the payload at offsets 0x2A and 0x30.
This embedded IP address is not as important for this attack because during the replay our scripts can become the patient monitor’s IP; however, this will become more important later.
The newly discovered counter needs to be accounted for and incremented.
Emulating a patient monitor By taking these new findings into account our replay attack becomes successful.
