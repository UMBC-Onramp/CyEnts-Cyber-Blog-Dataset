Yet, how do we access this code?
As this is a critical system, the firmware and software are not publicly available and there is limited documentation.
Thus, we are limited to external reconnaissance of the underlying system software.
Since the most critical vulnerabilities are remote, it made sense to start with a simple network scan of the device.
A TCP scan showed no ports open and a UDP scan only showed ports 47808 and 47809 to be open.
Referring to the documentation, we determined this is most likely used for a protocol called Building Automation Control Network (BACnet).
Using a BACnet-specific network enumeration script, we determined slightly more information: root@kali:~
# nmap â€“script bacnet-info -sU
-p 47808 192.168.7.15
