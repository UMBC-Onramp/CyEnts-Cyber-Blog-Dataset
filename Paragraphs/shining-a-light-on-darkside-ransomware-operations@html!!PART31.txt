If the OS is older than Windows 10, the malware uses a documented slui.exe file handler hijack technique .
This involves setting the registry value HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\exefile\\shell\\open\\command\\Default to the malware path and executing slui.exe using the verb \"runas.\"
If the OS version is Windows 10 or newer, the malware attempts a UAC bypass that uses the CMSTPLUA COM interface .
The decrypted strings listed in Figure 7 are used to perform this technique.

The malware generates a pseudo-random file extension based on a MAC address on the system.
In a DARKSIDE version observed in May 2021, the file extension is generated using a MachineGuid registry value as a seed rather than the MAC address.
