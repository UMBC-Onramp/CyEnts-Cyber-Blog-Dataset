Code Structure Comparison between GM Bot and SlemBunk Figure 2 shows the code structure similarity between one GM Bot sample and one SlemBunk sample (SHA256 9425fca578661392f3b12e1f1d83b8307bfb94340ae797c2f121d365852a775e and SHA256 e072a7a8d8e5a562342121408493937ecdedf6f357b1687e6da257f40d0c6b27 for GM Bot and SlemBunk, respectively).
From this figure, we can see that the five major components we discussed in our previous post [ 4 ] are also present in GM Bot sample.
Other common classes include: Main , the launching activity of both samples.
MyApplication , the application class that starts before any other activities of both samples.
