Below is an example of a request leveraging this exploit: We collected a number of payloads leveraging this vulnerability, and eventually found a downloader.
After tracing the traffic capture, the complete payload is shown in the following  figure: First, because the final Moobot will be saved as “macHelper,” it first tries to remove any file already named “macHelper.”
It then echoes code into “downloader,” which is a small ELF 32-bit LSB ARM file.
After downloader completes downloading, it executes Moobot with the parameter “hikivision”.
Finally, it changes commonly used commands, such as “reboot,” to prevent an administrator from invoking reboot on the affected device.
Stage 1 - Downloader The attacker leverages this vulnerability to drop a downloader (SHA256: 1DCE6F3BA4A8D355DF21A17584C514697EE0C37B51AB5657BC5B3A297B65955F).
