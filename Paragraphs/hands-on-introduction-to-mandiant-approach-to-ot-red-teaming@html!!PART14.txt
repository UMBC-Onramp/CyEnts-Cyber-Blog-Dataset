Passive analysis of the capture showed Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) broadcasts for IPv6 addresses, Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol traffic, and NetBios Name Service (NBT-NS) traffic.
We responded to broadcast LLMNR, NBT-NS, and WPAD name resolution requests from devices using a publicly available tool called Responder.
As we supplied our IP address in response to broadcasted name resolution requests from other clients on the subnet, we performed man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks and obtained NTLMv1/2 authentication protocol password hashes from devices on the network.
We then used Hashcat to crack the hashed credentials and use them for further lateral movement and compromise.
The credentials we obtained included, but were not limited to, service accounts with local administrator rights on OPC servers and clients.
We note that Hashcat cracked the captured credentials in only six seconds due to the lack of password strength and complexity.
With the credentials captured in the first three steps, we accessed other hosts on the network using CrackMapExec.
We dumped additional cached usernames, passwords, and password hashes belonging to both local and domain accounts from these hosts.
This resulted in privileged access and control over the DCS's OPC clients and servers in the network.
