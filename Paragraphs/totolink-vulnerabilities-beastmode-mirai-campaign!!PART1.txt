FortiGuard Labs Research Affected Platforms: Linux Impacted Users: Any organization Impact: Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systems Severity Level: Critical Between February and March 2022, our FortiGuard Labs team observed that the Beastmode (aka B3astmode) Mirai-based DDoS campaign has aggressively updated its arsenal of exploits.
Five new exploits were added within a month, with three targeting various models of TOTOLINK routers.
This inclusion of TOTOLINK exploits is especially noteworthy as they were added just a week after the exploit codes were published on GitHub.
We previously reported on the MANGA campaign , which similarly adopted exploit code within weeks of their release.
By rapidly adopting newly released exploit code, threat actors can potentially infect vulnerable devices and expand their botnets before patches are applied to fix these vulnerabilities.
TOTOLINK has already released updated firmware for affected models and users are strongly encouraged to update their devices.
