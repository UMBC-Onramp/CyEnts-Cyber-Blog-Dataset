Malware often wants to inject into user mode since much of the common functionality (such as network communication) within Windows can be more easily accessed.
In addition, by running in user mode, there is less risk of being detected in the event of faulty code bug-checking the entire machine.
In order to queue an APC to fire in user mode, the malware must locate a thread in an “alertable” state.
