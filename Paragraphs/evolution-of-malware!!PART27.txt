MyDoom (2004)
This was the fastest spreading email worm, surpassing I LOVE YOU.
MyDoom still holds the record for this feat.
The Dawn of Cybercrime 2005:
Mytob/Zotob, combining worms/backdoors/botnet Before Mytob, the world of malware was mainly limited to enthusiasts who created malware out of a desire to create mischief or sheer curiosity.
However, the Mytob/Zotob variants changed everything.
Mytob essentially combined the functionality of a worm/backdoor/botnet.
It is a variant of MyDoom and was created by the same coder that created the Zotob worm.
Mytob infected victim machines in two ways.
It either arrived via email through malicious attachments or exploited vulnerabilities in the LSASS (MS04-011) protocol or RCP-DCOM (MS04-012) and used remote code execution.
It also utilized the victimâ€™s address book to propagate itself and searched for other machines via network scans to see if they could be compromised.
