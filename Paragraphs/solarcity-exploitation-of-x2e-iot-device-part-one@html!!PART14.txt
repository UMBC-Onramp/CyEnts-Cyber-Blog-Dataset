In our case, the NAND we were dealing with was a Spansion S34ML01G1, and its datasheet could be found here .
NAND Overview
Before we talk about acquiring the firmware from the NAND chip, it’s important to first understand the various scenarios that embedded devices typically follow.
NAND verses NOR : These fundamentally different technologies each have their own benefits and drawbacks.
NAND is cheap but suffers from high probability of “bad blocks,” or areas that are corrupt sometimes directly from the factory.
