We can use de4dot to automatically deobfuscate the MassLogger payload.
However, looking at the deobfuscated payload, we quickly identify a major issue: Most of the methods contain almost no logic as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: dnSpy showing empty methods Looking at the original MassLogger payload in dnSpy â€™s Intermediate Language (IL) view confirms that most methods do not contain any logic and simply return nothing.
This is obviously not the real malware since we already observed with dynamic analysis that the sample indeed performs malicious activities and logging to a log file.
We are left with a few methods, most notably the method with the token 0x0600049D called first thing in the main module constructor.
