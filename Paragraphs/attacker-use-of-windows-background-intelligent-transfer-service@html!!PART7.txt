The most recent transaction log is stored to a file called edb.log , and three older transaction logs with numerical suffixes are typically present.
Parsing ESE Databases
In order to support investigations on Windows 10 systems, we updated the BitsParser tool to support the new QMGR database format.
To accomplish this, we needed a Python-based ESE database parser.
Research led us to libesedb , which is a full ESE database implementation written in C with a Python wrapper.
With no other Python options available, we initially used libesedb in BitsParser to parse the Windows 10 QMGR database.
However, we sought a solution that did not rely on native executables and would be more compact for improved efficiency in large scale deployments.
