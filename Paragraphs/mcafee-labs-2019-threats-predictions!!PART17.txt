In 2019, we predict attackers will more frequently combine these tactics to create multifaced, or synergistic, threats.
What could be worse?
Attacks are usually centered on the use of one threat.
Bad actors concentrate their efforts on iterating and evolving one threat at a time for effectiveness and evasion.
When an attack is successful, it is classified as ransomware, cryptojacking, data exfiltration, etc., and defenses are put in place.
At this point, the attackâ€™s success rate is significantly reduced.
However, if a sophisticated attack involves not one but five top-notch threats synergistically working together, the defense panorama could become very blurry.
The challenge arises when an attempt is made to identify and mitigate the attack.
Because the ultimate attack goals are unknown, one might get lost in the details of each threat as it plays a role in the chain.
One of the reasons synergic threats are becoming a reality is because bad actors are improving their skills by developing foundations, kits, and reusable threat components .
As attackers organize their efforts into a black-market business model, they can focus on adding value to previous building blocks.
