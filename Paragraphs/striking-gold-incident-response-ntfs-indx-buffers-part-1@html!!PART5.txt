Using various forensic tools, we are capable of this as demonstrated below.
The SleuthKit We can use the SleuthKit tools to extract both the INDX root and allocation data.
To extract the INDX attribute using the SleuthKit, the first step is to identify the $MFT record IDs for the attributes of the inode.
We want the content of the index root attribute (attribute type 0x90 or 144d) and the index allocation attribute (attribute type 0xA0 or 160d).
To identify the attribute IDs, run the command: istat -f ntfs ntfs.dd 49 The istat command returns inode information from the $MFT.
In the command we are specifying the NTFS file system with the \"-f\" switch.
The tool reads a raw image named \"ntfs.dd\" and locates record number 49.
The result of our output (truncated) was as follows: ....
Attributes: Type: $STANDARD_INFORMATION (16-0)
Name: Resident size: 72 ...
Type: $I30 (144-6) Name: $I30 Resident size: 26 Type: $I30 (160-7) Name: $I30 Non-Resident size: 4096
