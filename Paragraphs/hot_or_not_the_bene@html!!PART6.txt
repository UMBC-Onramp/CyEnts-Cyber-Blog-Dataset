JSPatch setup in the targeted app There is a sequence of flow from the app entry point (in this case the AppDelegate class) to where the JavaScript file containing updates or patch code is written to the file system.
This process involves communicating with the remote server to retrieve the patch code.
On our test device, we eventually found that the JavaScript patch code is hashed and stored at the location shown in Figure 5.
The corresponding content is shown in Figure 6 in Base64-encoded format: Figure 5.

Encrypted patch content While the target app developer has taken steps to secure this sensitive data from prying eyes by employing Base64 encoding on top of a symmetric encryption, one can easily render this attempt futile by running a few commands through Cycript .
The patch code, once decrypted, is shown in Figure 7: Figure 7.
