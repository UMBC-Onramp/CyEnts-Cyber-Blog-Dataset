Additionally, any system threads or work items that are created are sequentially emulated in order to get as much code coverage as possible.
Emulating a Kernel Mode Implant
In this blog post, we will show an example of Speakeasyâ€™s effectiveness at emulating a real kernel mode implant family publicly named Winnti.
This sample was chosen despite its age because it transparently implements some classic rootkit functionality.
The goal of this post is not to discuss the analysis of the malware itself as it is fairly antiquated.
Rather, we will focus on the events that are captured during emulation.
The Winnti sample we will be analyzing has SHA256 hash c465238c9da9c5ea5994fe9faf1b5835767210132db0ce9a79cb1195851a36fb and the original file name tcprelay.sys .
