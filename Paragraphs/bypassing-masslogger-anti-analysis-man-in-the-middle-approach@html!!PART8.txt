Interesting strings scattered throughout the module A quick internet search for “ clrjit.dll ” and “ VirtualProtect ” quickly takes us to a few publications describing a technique commonly referred to as Just-In-Time Hooking.
In essence, JIT Hooking involves installing a hook at the compileMethod() function where the JIT compiler is about to compile the MSIL into assembly (x86, x64, etc).
With the hook in place, the malware can easily replace each method body with the real MSIL that contains the original malware logic.
To fully understand this process, let’s explore the .NET executable, the .NET methods, and how MSIL turns into x86 or x64 assembly.
