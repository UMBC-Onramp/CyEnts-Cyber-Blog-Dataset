The scheduled tasks created by ANCHOR are often unnamed, although that is not always the case.
The identification of named scheduled tasks associated with ANCHOR persistence may be constructed according to the following pattern: < Random directory within %APPDATA% > autoupdate#< random number >.
All unnamed scheduled tasks should be reviewed, particularly those with a creation date consistent with the time of the suspected compromise.
Although it is a low fidelity indicator, ANCHOR activity may also sometimes be identified by searching for binaries within the C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64 directory that have a file name matching the following pattern: < 8 random lowercase chars >.exe.
Stacking or sorting on file creation timestamps in the C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64 directory may also help identify malicious files, as the directory should be mostly static.
Post-exploitation activity associated with the deployment of ransomware following these campaigns is typically conducted using the Cobalt Strike attack framework.
The BEACON payload associated with Cobalt Strike can often be identified via a review of existing registered services and service creation events (Event ID 7045), both markers of the mechanism it most commonly employs to maintain persistence.
The following are additional strategies that may aid in identifying associated activity: Organizations can review web proxy logs in order to identify HXXP requests for file storage, project management, collaboration or communication services with a referrer from a Google Docs document.
During the associated post-compromise activity, attackers have commonly staged their tools and data in the PerfLogs directory and C$ share.
While collecting data used to enable later-stage operations, the attackers commonly leave instances of ntds.dit and exports of the SYSTEM and SECURITY registry hives on impacted systems.
