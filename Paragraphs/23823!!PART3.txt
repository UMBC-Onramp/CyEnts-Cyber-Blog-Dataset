In essence, this attack is a fake restart.
What is NoReboot, and how does the attack work?
We want to note right off the bat that NoReboot is not a feature of any real spyware in use by attackers; rather, it’s a so-called proof of concept that researchers demonstrated under laboratory conditions.
At this point it is hard to say whether the method will actually gain traction.
For the demonstration, the researchers used an iPhone they “infected” beforehand.
Unfortunately, they haven’t shared the technical details.
Here’s what happens in the demonstration: The spy malware, which transfers the image from the camera, runs on the iPhone; The user tries to shut off the phone the usual way, using the power and volume buttons; The malware takes control and shows a perfect fake instead of the standard iOS shutdown screen; After the user drags the power-off slider, which also looks perfectly normal, the smartphone’s screen goes dark and the phone no longer responds to any of the user’s actions; When the user presses the power button again, the malware displays a perfect replica of the iOS boot animation.
During the entire process, the phone is continually transferring the image from the phone’s front camera to another device without the user’s knowledge.
