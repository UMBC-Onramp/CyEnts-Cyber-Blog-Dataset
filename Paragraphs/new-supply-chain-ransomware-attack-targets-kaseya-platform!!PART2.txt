Those same unofficial reports claim that a malicious update was deployed to the Kaseya VSA interface by the threat actors as an update or hot fix for the Kaseya VSA agent.
This fake update is a ransomware file, and it has now been downloaded to thousands of systems, including the machines of MSP providers and their customers who use Kaseya VSA.
 There are reports of ransom demands of $50,000 for smaller organizations and up to $5 million for larger enterprises.
Kaseya is urging all customers to take all on-premises VSA servers offline immediately.
Only on-premises systems have been impacted by this attack.
Cloud-based SaaS services remain unaffected.
The Kaseya advisory reads in part: \"ALL ON-PREMISES VSA SERVERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO REMAIN OFFLINE UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM KASEYA ABOUT WHEN IT IS SAFE TO RESTORE OPERATIONS.
