Although this particular malware is listed in some OSINT reports as potentially related to the Olympic Destroyer sample, we have not observed this to be the case.
We also do not have any information on the delivery mechanism or methods used by the attacker, nor its intended targets.
However, given its ties to the Olympics, and the relative short time frame for exploitation, we feel it is important that we share what we know so far about this new wiper malware.
