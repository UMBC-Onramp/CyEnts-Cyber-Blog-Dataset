Updates from Incident Response Investigations We continue to suspect that multiple groups including UNC2630 and UNC2717 are responsible for this activity, despite the use of similar exploits and tools.
There is a high degree of variation in attacker actions within victim environments, with actors inconsistently using a combination of tools and command and control IP addresses.
Reverse engineers on the FLARE team have identified four additional malware families specifically designed to manipulate Pulse Secure devices (Table 1).
These utilities have similar functions to the 12 previously documented malware families: harvesting credentials and sensitive system data, allowing arbitrary file execution, and removing forensic evidence.
Please see the Technical Annex for detailed analysis of these code families.
Malware Family Description Actor BLOODMINE BLOODMINE is a utility for parsing Pulse Secure Connect log files.
It extracts information related to logins, Message IDs and Web Requests and copies the relevant data to another file.
UNC2630 BLOODBANK BLOODBANK is a credential theft utility that parses two files containing password hashes or plaintext passwords and expects an output file to be given at the command prompt.
UNC2630 CLEANPULSE CLEANPULSE is a memory patching utility that may be used to prevent certain log events from occurring.
