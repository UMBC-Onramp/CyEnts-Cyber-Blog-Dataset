A number of clinics have reported temporary shutdowns or at least disruptions in their operations, although they continue to provide emergency care services.

The Irish healthcare system attack in brief
According to HSE representatives, a “very sophisticated,” human-operated ransomware attack caused “significant disruption” to their services.
Such incidents are particularly difficult to counter because the cybercriminals adjust their tactics and specific targets during the attack.
External experts and law enforcement cyberspecialists are contributing to the investigation, which is still in early stages.
However, HSE representatives presume the main target was data stored on the organization’s servers.
Representatives of Rotunda Hospital, a medical institution affected by the attack, say the unified HSE patient registering system may have been a spreading vector.
Fortunately, the attack did not affect life-saving equipment; only healthcare records are unavailable.
