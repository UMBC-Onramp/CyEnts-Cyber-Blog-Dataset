This is not a case of BadUSB, man in the middle, or rogue Wi-Fi, just simple voice commands and interacting with the device’s touchscreen or mouse.
Several months ago, researchers from Israel demonstrated a similar attack using a BadUSB device, masquerading as a network interface card to inject content into trusted HTTP sites while using Cortana to force navigation.
Microsoft has since removed this ability to navigate directly to a domain and instead now opens a search in Bing over HTTPS to the domain in question.
Some of our findings could also be combined with a BadUSB approach.
We explored whether one could still force navigation to an attacker-controlled page.
In short, yes, one can, but it does take some extra effort.
Cortana is very helpful when it comes to defining terms, or looking up corporations, movies, artists, or athletes.
She can even do math.
However, Cortana’s behavior and the answers she gives are affected by the way you ask a question.
For example, if you were to ask the colloquial question “ Hey Cortana, what is McAfee? ”
you would get a quick answer directly from a Bing search.
