This allows us to rename functions and pointers on the fly as the script runs all in one shot.
This is where the network client capability comes in.
Again, there are many approaches to this.
Here we chose to integrate a network client into a beta of IDA Jscript (Figure 6).
IDA Jscript is an open source IDA scripting tool with IDE that includes syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, function prototype tooltips, and debugger.
Figure 6: Open source IDA Jscript decoding and resolving API addresses
In this example we see a script that decodes the xdata pointer table, resolves the API address over the network, and then generates an IDC script to rename the pointers in IDA.
After running this script and applying the results, the decompiler output becomes plainly readable (Figure 7).
