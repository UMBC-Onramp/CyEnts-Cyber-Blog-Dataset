With a closer look at the baseboard, we made a few key observations.
First, the processor is an ARM926EJ core processor, the flash module is a ball grid array (BGA) chip, and there are several unpopulated headers on the board.
Figure 2 To examine the software more effectively, we needed to determine a method of extracting the firmware.
The BGA chip used by the system for flash memory will mostly likely hold the firmware; however, this poses another challenge.
Unlike other chips, BGA chips do not provide pins externally which can be attached to.
This means to access the chip directly, we would need to desolder the chip from the board.
This is not ideal since we risk damaging the system.
We also noticed several unpopulated headers on the board.
This was promising as we could find an alternative method of exacting the firmware using one of these headers.
