GPT-2’s authors and subsequent researchers have warned about potential malicious use cases enabled by this powerful natural language generation technology, and while it was conducted here for a defensive application in a controlled offline setting using readily available open source data, our research reinforces this concern.
As trends towards more powerful and readily available language generation models continue , it is important to redouble efforts towards detection as demonstrated by Figure 5 and other promising approaches such as Grover .
This research was conducted during a three-month FireEye IGNITE University Program summer internship, and represents a collaboration between the FDS and FireEye Threat Intelligence’s Information Operations Analysis teams.
If you are interested in working on multidisciplinary projects at the intersection of cyber security and machine learning, please consider applying to one of our 2020 summer internships .
