In this field, complete control of the operating system is typically the finish line.
But we weren’t content with just that.
After all, controlling the eBMGR on its own is not all that interesting; we wanted to see if we could use it to control all the devices it was connected to.
Unfortunately, we did not have the source code for the device’s software, so this new goal proved non-trivial.
We went back to the drawing board and acquired some additional hardware that the Delta device might realistically be charged with managing and had a certified technician program the device just as he would for a real-world client – in our case, as an HVAC controller.
Our strategy quickly became what is often referred to as a replay attack.
As an example, if we wanted to determine how to tell the device to flip a switch, we would first observe the device flipping the switch in the “normal” way and try to track down what code had to run for that to happen.
