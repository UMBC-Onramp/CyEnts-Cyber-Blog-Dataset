This campaign used payloads from different malware families.
To keep the draft concise, we did not include the analysis of all of them.
The decompilation of one of the payloads with hash 1BA398B0A14328B9604EEB5EBF139B40 shows keylogging capabilities (Figure 21).
We later identified this sample as QuasarRAT.
Figure 21:
Keylogging capabilities The decompilation of all the .NET-based payload shows that much of the code is written in Chinese.
The decompilation of malware with hash BCC49643833A4D8545ED4145FB6FDFD2 containing Chinese text is shown in Figure 22.
We later identified this sample as Buzy.
