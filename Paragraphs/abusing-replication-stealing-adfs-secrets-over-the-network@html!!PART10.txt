It is also key to understand that although there is a single primary AD FS server, all nodes in an AD FS farm run this WCF service and can be used for replication.
Upon receipt of a message, the WCF service enforces an authorization check to ensure the calling identity is permitted to receive the requested information.
The permission check is done by evaluating an authorization policy that is also stored in the IdentityServerPolicy.
ServiceStateSummary table of the AD FS database.
The policy permits identities whose primary SID matches the AD FS Service account or to any identity that is member of the AD FS serverâ€™s local administrators group.
If the identity of the client passes the authorization check, then the WCF service will send back a message containing the requested information.
