Dropper “main.dll” acts as a dropper for IcedID.
Static analysis of the file reveals an interesting point.
What at appears at first glance to be an easy win for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) because it contains a domain and IP address, turns out to be slightly more complicated.
In comparing the area of code where the strings in Figure 5 are stored, we find that this area is not called by any functions within “main.dll”.
To illustrate this, the right-hand side of the very first line in Figure 6 contains “Data XREF:”.
This indicates that it is referenced elsewhere in the code.
The strings from Figure 5, however, do not include this information, indicating they are not.
By investigating further, the story becomes even more interesting.
This code appears in a StackOverflow question from approximately 10 years ago concerning an issue about downloading an image over HTTP ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9389183/downloading-a-picture-with-http-get-only-downloads-a-small-part-of-it ).
It should be noted that there is no malicious intent with the content of that posting.
That it is now part of “main.dll” indicates it is a decoy for analysts in the hope the actual indicators won’t be blocked.
