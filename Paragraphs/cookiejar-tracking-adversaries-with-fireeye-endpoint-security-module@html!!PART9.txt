Malware Appendix
During the course of the response, Mandiant identified a customized malicious Apache plugin capable of intercepting HTTP requests to an Apache HTTP server.
The new malware family COOKIEJAR was created to aid in clustering and tracking this activity.
The COOKIEJAR module installs a pre-connection hook that only runs if the client IP address matches a specified hardcoded adversary-controlled IP address.
It listens for SSL/TLS connections on the port specified by the Apache server, using a certificate and private key loaded from /tmp/cacert.pem and /tmp/privkey.pem respectively.
