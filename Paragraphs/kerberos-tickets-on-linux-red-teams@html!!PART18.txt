This Authenticator is encrypted with the first session key (the TGT session key).
The service ticket, Authenticator, and metadata are bundled in a TGS-REP packet and forwarded back to the user.
An example TGS-REP packet is shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8: TGS-REP
Once Windows receives the TGS-REP for cifs/SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP, Windows extracts the service ticket from the packet and caches it into memory.
It also decrypts the Authenticator with the TGT specific session key to obtain the new service specific session key.
Using both pieces of information, it is now possible for the user to authenticate to the remote file share.
Windows negotiates a SMB connection with SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP.
It places a Kerberos blob in an \"ap-req\" structure.
This Kerberos blob includes the service ticket received from the domain controller, a new Authenticator structure, and metadata.
