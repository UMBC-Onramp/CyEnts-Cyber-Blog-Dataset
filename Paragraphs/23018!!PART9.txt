How to guard against scam calls If you spot at least one of the above red flags, the best option is simply to end the conversation.
After that, call the company or organization that supposedly just called you and report the incident — the more information they collect, the more likely they are to catch, or at least hinder, the fraudsters.
Look up the tech or customer support number separately, for example by going to the organization’s official website.
In addition, resolutely avoid installing remote access programs on your computer, however convincing any caller may be, and use a reliable security solution that detects dangerous applications in good time and warns you about them.
