Maze creates a mutex with the name “Global\\x” where x is a special value that is unique per machine.
For example, in the next screenshot (some information has been deleted to anonymize the machine used for the analysis) is an example of this behavior.
It is done to avoid two or more executions at the same time.

CREATION OF A MUTEX TO AVOID DOUBLE EXECUTION.
UNIQUE PER MACHINE
The malware, after creating the mutex, makes calls to the function “GetLastError” to check against two errors: 0x05 -> ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
