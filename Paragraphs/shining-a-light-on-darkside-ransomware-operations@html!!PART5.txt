In April 2021, darksupp posted an update for the \"Darkside 2.0\" RaaS that included several new features and a description of the types of partners and services they were currently seeking (Table 1).
Affiliates retain a percentage of the ransom fee from each victim.
Based on forum advertisements, the RaaS operators take 25% for ransom fees less than $500,000, but this decreases to 10 percent for ransom fees greater than $5 million.
