In Android, when a service is started its onCreate method will be called.
In method onCreate of both samples, a static variable is first set to true.
In GM Bot, this variable is named “a”, while in SlemBunk it is named “isRunning”.
Then both will move forward to read an app particular preference.
Note that the preferences in both samples have the same name: “AppPrefs”.
The last tasks of these two main services are also the same.
