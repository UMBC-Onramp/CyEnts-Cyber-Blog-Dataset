Limitations As said, emulation comes with some challenges.
Maintaining feature parity with the system being emulated is an ongoing battle; however, it provides unique opportunities for controlling the malware and greater introspection options.
In cases where emulation does not complete fully, emulation reports and memory dumps can still be generated in order to gather as much data as possible.
For example, a backdoor may successfully install its persistence mechanism, but fail to connect to its C2 server.
In this situation, the valuable host-based indicators are still logged and can provide value to an analyst.
Missing API handlers can quickly and easily be added to the emulator in order to handle these situations.
