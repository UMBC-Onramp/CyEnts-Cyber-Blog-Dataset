Using the Wemo as a middleman, the attacker can power the TV on and off, install or uninstall applications, and access arbitrary online content.
Smart TVs are just one example of using the Wemo to attack another device.
With the attacker having established a foothold on the network and able to open arbitrary ports, any machine connected to the network is at risk.
Because attacks can be conducted through the Wemo and the port mappings generated using this exploit are not visible from the router’s administration page, the attacker’s footprint remains small and hard to detect.
Conclusion Discoveries such as CVE-2018-6692 underline the importance of secure coding practices on all devices.
IoT devices are frequently overlooked from a security perspective; this may be because many are used for seemingly innocuous purposes such as simple home automation.
However, these devices run operating systems and require just as much protection as desktop computers.
A vulnerability such as we discovered could become the foothold an attacker needs to enter and compromise an entire business network.
One goal of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team is to identify and illuminate a broad spectrum of threats in today’s complex and constantly evolving landscape.
Through analysis and responsible disclosure, we aim to guide product manufacturers toward a more comprehensive security posture.
