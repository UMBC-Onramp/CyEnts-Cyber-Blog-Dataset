We believe this enables UNC2452 to compartmentalize their operations, limiting the network infrastructure shared among victims.
The C2 coordinator is implemented as the authoritative DNS server for the avsvmcloud[.]com domain.
To communicate with the C2 coordinator, SUNBURST uses a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to construct subdomains of avsvmcloud[.]com and resolves the fully qualified domain names (FQDN) using the system DNS client.
The backdoor interprets the DNS responses in an unusual way to receive orders from the C2 coordinator.
The DGA generates subdomains with the following DNS suffixes to create the FQDN: .appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-west-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-east-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-east-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com A method named Update is responsible for initializing cryptographic helpers for the generation of these random-looking C2 subdomains.
Subdomains are generated by concatenating an encoded user ID with an encoding of the system's domain name.
The C2 coordinator can recover the victim domain name from the encoded data and likely uses this to route SUNBURST to its final C2 server.
