We can cross-reference these times with data from SCANdalous to help us understand the impact of our external detection.
Looking at the IP addresses marked by an analyst as observed at a client in the last year, we find that 21.7% (more than one in five) were also found by SCANdalous.
Of that fifth, SCANdalous has an average lead time of 47 days.
If we only consider the IP addresses that SCANdalous found first, the average lead time jumps to 106 days.
Going even deeper and examining this data month-to-month, we find a steady upward trend in the percentage of IP addresses identified by SCANdalous before being observed at a client (Figure 3).
