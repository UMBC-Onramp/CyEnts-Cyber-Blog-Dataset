Some evidence suggests that the group may have used the exploit since August 2018.
While open sources have suggested that the group potentially acquired the zero-day from criminal underground actor \" BuggiCorp ,\" we have not identified direct evidence linking this actor to this exploit's development or sale.
Conclusion We surmise that access to zero-day capabilities is becoming increasingly commodified based on the proportion of zero-days exploited in the wild by suspected customers of private companies.
Possible reasons for this include: Private companies are likely creating and supplying a larger proportion of zero-days than they have in the past, resulting in a concentration of zero-day capabilities among highly resourced groups.
Private companies may be increasingly providing offensive capabilities to groups with lower overall capability and/or groups with less concern for operational security, which makes it more likely that usage of zero-days will be observed.
