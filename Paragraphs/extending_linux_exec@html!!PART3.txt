File execution logs are available in various forms and locations in Linux, but the logs we will be generating contain a wealth of data in one location that would otherwise need to be gathered from several disparate sources or may have not have been available at all.
First, you should familiarize yourself with documentation for your Linux distribution to verify whether the IMA kernel compilation options are enabled by default.
The IMA subsystem has been part of the mainline kernel since version 2.6.30, but not every distribution compiles their kernel with these options enabled.
All of the examples in this post were tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, as the IMA kernel options are enabled by default in this distribution.
