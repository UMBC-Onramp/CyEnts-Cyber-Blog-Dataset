And synthetic media\nwould drastically lower barriers for actors seeking to disseminate\ndiverse text-based content at scale, reducing the effort required to\ncreate a large corpus of written content and the need to repeatedly\nreuse snippets of identical text.
Evading Detection Synthetic media doesn’t need to be overwhelmingly credible to\nhave its desired effect.
People are used to consuming short,\nauthoritative, error-riddled social media text at speed without\ndwelling too much on its linguistic features or origin.
Users are\naccustomed to consuming poor-quality audio and video snippets, and the\nmajority of users aren’t going to give a social media account’s\nprofile image more than a cursory glance as they scroll through their\nfeed and ingest written content at rapid speed.
The quality bar does\nnot need to be exceedingly high when it comes to synthetic\ngenerations; it only needs to be “good enough” for even just a subset\nof vocal users to not question it in a world characterized by rapid,\nhigh-volume information consumption.
The unifying theme behind the various potential IO applications\ndiscussed in the previous section is that they would materially help\nthreat actors scale campaigns at low cost and better evade\ndetection.
