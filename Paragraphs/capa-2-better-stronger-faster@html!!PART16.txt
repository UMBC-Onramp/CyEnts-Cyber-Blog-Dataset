For more than 70% of capa rules we have collected associated real-world binaries.
Each binary implements interesting capabilities and exhibits noteworthy features.
You can view the entire sample collection at our capa test files GitHub page .
We rely heavily on these samples for developing and testing code enhancements and rule updates.
Python 3 Support Finally, we’ve spent nearly three months migrating capa from Python 2.7 to Python 3.
This involved working closely with vivisect and we would like to thank the team for their support.
After extensive testing and a couple of releases supporting two Python versions, we’re excited that capa 2.0 and future versions will be Python 3 only.
Conclusion Now that you’ve seen all the recent improvements to capa, we hope you’ll upgrade to the newest capa version right away!
Thanks to library function identification capa will report faster and more relevant results.
Hundreds of new rules capture the most interesting malware functionality while the improved capa explorer plugin helps you to focus your analysis and codify your malware knowledge while it’s fresh.
