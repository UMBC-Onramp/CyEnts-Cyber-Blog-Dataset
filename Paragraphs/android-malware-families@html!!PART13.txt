This new sample did not use Tor for private communications, but shared four of the five major components as the SlemBunk sample (SHA256: f3341fc8d7248b3d4e58a3ee87e4e675b5f6fc37f28644a2c6ca9c4d11c92b96).
Figure 6 shows the code structure comparison between these two samples.

Code structure comparison between SimpleLocker and SlemBunk variants As we can see in Figure 6, the new SimpleLocker sample used a packaging mechanism similar to SlemBunk, putting HttpSender and Utils into a sub-package named “utils”.
It also added two other major components that were originally only seen in SlemBunk: MessageReceiver and MyDeviceAdminReceiver .
