I've also seen a few variants of commodity malware that install a LNK file in the startup folder and deploy an EXE into a directory that the user can write to, like \" C: users local settings emp \".
LNK files contain several kinds of useful metadata, but for today's purposes we're interested in LNK files as pointers to other files.
In this recent case, we identified a novel technique that indirectly loads malicious scripts by means of LNK files in a user's start-up folder.
The LNK file was designed to invoke the Windows scripting host (WSH).
The WSH comes in both a GUI version, \"wscript.exe\", and a command-line version, \"cscript.exe\".
The WSH can interpret Visual Basic scripts, commonly denoted by the file extension \".vbs\", and Jscripts (Microsoft's implementation of JavaScript), commonly denoted by the file extension \".js\".
The malicious LNK file invoked \"wscript.exe\" to interpret a JScript file stored within a specific user's profile.
Here's a cleaned-up excerpt parsed from the LNK file using lnk-parser , depicting the relative path to the WSH (in yellow) and an argument (in green) which points to a JScript file: The JScript we found used an ActiveXObject object to create an instance of Internet Explorer and open a URL hosted by a code-sharing cloud service.
