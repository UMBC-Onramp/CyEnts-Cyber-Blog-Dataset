So far, so good — but the data read by the CPU is stored for some time in the cache, the CPU’s own memory.
Next comes the most interesting part: With no way to read the confidential data from the CPU’s cache directly, the malicious process deploys a so-called side-channel attack to steal it.
That involves measuring the speed of access to certain information.
If it’s relatively small, that means the data is located in the cache.
If large, it is loaded from regular RAM.
A set sequence of read attempts results in a leak of the secret information.
