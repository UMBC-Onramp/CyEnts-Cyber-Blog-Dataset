NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Query UAL with New Leads Now that we’ve built a list of suspicious IP addresses (or even entire CIDR ranges) and User-Agent strings, we’ll run new queries against the entire UAL to try to identify other compromised user accounts.
We’ll repeat this step and the previous step for each newly identified user account.
One advantage to using FireEye Helix platform over PowerShell is that we can query entire CIDR ranges.
This is helpful when we observe attackers coming from a VPN or ISP that dynamically assigns IP addresses within the same address block.
