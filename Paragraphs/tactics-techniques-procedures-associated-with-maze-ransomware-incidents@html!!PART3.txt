Figure 1: Geographical and industry distribution of alleged MAZE victims Multiple Actors Involved in MAZE Ransomware Operations Identified Mandiant identified multiple Russian-speaking actors who claimed to use MAZE ransomware and were seeking partners to fulfill different functional roles within their teams.
Additional information on these actors is available to Mandiant Intelligence subscribers .
A panel used to manage victims targeted for MAZE ransomware deployment has a section for affiliate transactions.
This activity is consistent with our assessment that MAZE operates under an affiliate model and is not distributed by a single group.
Under this business model, ransomware developers will partner with other actors (i.e. affiliates) who are responsible for distributing the malware.
In these scenarios, when a victim pays the ransom demand, the ransomware developers receive a commission.
Direct affiliates of MAZE ransomware also partner with other actors who perform specific tasks for a percentage of the ransom payment.
This includes partners who provide initial access to organizations and pentesters who are responsible for reconnaissance, privilege escalation and lateral movementâ€”each of which who appear to work on a percentage-basis.
