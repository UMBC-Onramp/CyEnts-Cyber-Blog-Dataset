Different evasions for different malware
In 2018, we observed the emergence of new threats such as cryptocurrency miners, which hijack the resources of infected machines.
With each threat comes inventive evasion techniques: Cryptocurrency mining:
Miners implement a number of evasion techniques.
Minerva Labs discovered WaterMiner, which simply stops its mining process when the victim runs the Task Manager or an antimalware scan.
Exploit kits: Popular evasion techniques include process injection or the manipulation of memory space and adding arbitrary code.
In-memory injection is a popular infection vector for avoiding detection during delivery.
Botnets: Code obfuscation or anti-disassembling techniques are often used by large botnets that infect thousands of victims.
In May 2018, AdvisorsBot was discovered using junk code, fake conditional instructions, XOR encryption, and even API hashing.
Because bots tend to spread widely, the authors implemented many evasion techniques to slow reverse engineering.
