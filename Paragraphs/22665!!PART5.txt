The prize is juicy, too: 2.5 Ethereum and 25,000 ZKSwap coins — more than $75,000 at the time of posting.
A scam message from a fake exchange about winning helicopter ETH and ZKS If one ignores the unusually generous airdrop, the message looks credible:
The language is awkward but not riddled with major errors, the level of emoji use is reasonable, and the list of exchanges includes reputable names.
It even includes believable T&Cs for receiving the prize.
The brevity of the link to the giveaway might arouse suspicion, but that’s unlikely; many are already accustomed to shortened addresses such as t.co or bit.ly links.
The link leads to a page very similar to the Uniswap website — and the fairly well-known exchange actually held a helicopter money promotion for clients not so long ago.
