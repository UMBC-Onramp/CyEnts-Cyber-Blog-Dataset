The Morris worm The difference between a virus and a worm is that a worm doesn’t need human interaction to propagate.
Over 30 years ago, the world’s first worm was born.
It was called the Morris worm, after its author, Robert Morris.

It was created as a Proof of Concept to see if hands-off replication was possible.
The worm contained several firsts.
It exploited vulnerabilities in various programs and services and checked to see if an existing infection was present, all behaviors of modern malware.
And because Morris was worried that system administrators would quarantine the worm and ignore the infection, he programmed it for persistence.
