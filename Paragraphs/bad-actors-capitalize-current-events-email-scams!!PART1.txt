FortiGuard Labs Research Affected Platforms: Windows Impacted Users: Windows users Impact:
Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actor.
Stolen personally identifiable information (PII), credential theft, monetary loss, etc.
Severity Level: Medium Malicious email and phishing scams are usually topical and follow a pattern of current events.
They are usually crafted around calendar and/or trending issues as attackers realize that victims are interested in all things relevant to the moment.
Threat actors are aware that not all recipients will bite, but some will, hence the origination of the term “phishing.”
Threat actors often put in the least amount of work possible for a maximum return, sending out phishing emails to thousands of targets.
Even if less than one percent of victims respond, the return on investment is still significant due to the gain of personally identifiable information (PII) and/or establishing a foothold within an organization using stolen credentials, malware, or other means.
This blog highlights some examples we’ve encountered that may help users better spot suspicious emails.
Recent examples observed by FortiGuard Labs include emails related to tax season and the Ukrainian conflict, which reflect the timeliness of current and newsworthy events at the time of writing.
Tax Season Scams Tax season comes around annually, like other seasonal events or holidays.
Targeting calendar-based events enables threat actors to prepare ahead of time and have a new selection of targets on rotation.
