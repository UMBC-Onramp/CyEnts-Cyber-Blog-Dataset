While analyzing the windows payloads for WinSpy we discovered that it also had Android spying components, which we have dubbed GimmeRat.
The Android tool has multiple components allowing the victim’s device to be controlled by another mobile device remotely over SMS messages or alternatively through a Windows-based controller.
The Windows-based controller is simplistic and requires physical access to the device.
The recent surge in Android-based RATs such as Dendroid and AndroRAT shows a spike in the interest of malicious actors to control mobile devices.
