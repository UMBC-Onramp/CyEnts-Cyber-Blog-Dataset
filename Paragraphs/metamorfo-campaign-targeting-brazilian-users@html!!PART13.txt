Those files are downloaded and saved into random directories named with the following patterns: <current user dir>\\<5 random chars>\\<8 random chars>\\<4 random chars>\\<5 random chars>.exe <current user dir>\\<5 random chars>\\<8 random chars>\\<4 random chars>\\CRYPTUI.dll The execution chain ensures that persistence is set on the affected system using a .lnk
 file in the Startup directory.
The .lnk file shown in Figure 17 opens the malicious VBS dropped on the system.
Figure 17:
Persistence Key The VBS file (Figure 18) will launch and execute the downloaded legitimate Windows tool, which in this case is Certmgr.exe.
This tool will be abused using the DLL side loading technique.
The malicious Cryptui.dll is loaded into the program instead of the legitimate one and executed.
