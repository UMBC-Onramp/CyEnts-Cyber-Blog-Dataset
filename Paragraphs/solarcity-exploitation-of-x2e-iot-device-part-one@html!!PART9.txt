To determine if the cluster of pins was a UART interface, we first soldered a 3-pin through-hole header to the PCB.
Using a combination of continuity tests with a multimeter and the digital logic analyzer Saleae , it became apparent that we were in fact dealing with a UART interface.
The Figure 5 shows the three pins (Ground, TX, RX) connected to the header.
Attached to the other end of the three wires was a FTDI serial TTL-232 to USB adapter , which was connected to a Linux virtual machine.

Connecting to potential UART interface In addition to correctly identifying the UART pins and a UART to USB adapter, we also needed software to read/write from the interface as well as knowledge of the baud rate.
Baud rates vary but typically follow standard values, including 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200.
