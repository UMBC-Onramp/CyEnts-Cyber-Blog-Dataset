However, 1986 also saw the launch of the first PC virus, dubbed “Brain.”
It changed the information security world as we know it today.
It originated in Pakistan but quickly spread worldwide to Europe and North America.
Ironically, the virus had replicated from machine to machine because of an anti-piracy countermeasure.
The Brain virus was developed by Amjad Farooq Alvi and Basit Farooq Alvi, two brothers from Pakistan who created a boot sector virus that loaded a warning to individuals using a pirated copy of their medical software.
Of course, because there wasn’t any internet, it spread through human interaction via the copying of floppy disks.
Unbeknownst to the user, the master boot record (MBR) of the victim’s machine was infected while making an illegal copy of the software and spread when the disk was inserted into the next machine.
Because there was no way to know that an infected MBR virus was coming along for the ride, it spread until it became a global phenomenon.
Luckily for many, it wasn’t a destructive virus.
It hid a particular sector so the machine wouldn’t boot and displayed a notification that included contact information of the Farooq Alvi brothers for remediation.
