At FireEye Mandiant , we conduct numerous red team engagements within Windows Active Directory environments.
Consequently, we frequently encounter Linux systems integrated within Active Directory environments.
Compromising an individual domain-joined Linux system can provide useful data on its own, but the best value is obtaining data, such as Kerberos tickets, that will facilitate lateral movement techniques.
By passing these Kerberos Tickets from a Linux system, it is possible to move laterally from a compromised Linux system to the rest of the Active Directory domain.
There are several ways to configure a Linux system to store Kerberos tickets.
In this blog post, we will introduce Kerberos and cover some of the various storage solutions.
