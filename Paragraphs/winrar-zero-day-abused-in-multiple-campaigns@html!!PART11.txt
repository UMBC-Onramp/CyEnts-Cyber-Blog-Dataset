This campaign uses credential dumps and likely stolen credit card dumps as decoy documents to distribute different types of RATs and password stealers.
One file, ‘leaks copy.rar’, used text files that contained stolen email IDs and passwords as decoys.
These files are shown as they would be displayed in WinRAR in Figure 19.
