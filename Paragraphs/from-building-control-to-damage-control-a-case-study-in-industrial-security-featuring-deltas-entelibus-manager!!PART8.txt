To make matters worse, if the attacker knows the IP address of the device ahead of time, this exploit can be performed over the Internet, increasing its impact exponentially.
At the time of this writing, a Shodan scan revealed that over 1600 such devices are internet connected, meaning the danger is far from hypothetical.
For those craving the nitty-gritty technical details of how we went about accomplishing this, we also published what is arguably a novella here that delves into the vulnerability discovery and exploitation process from start to finish.
In keeping with our responsible disclosure program , we reached out to Delta Controls as soon as we confirmed that the initial vulnerability we discovered was exploitable.
Shortly thereafter, they provided us with a beta version of a patch meant to fix the vulnerability and we confirmed that it did just that â€“ our attack no longer worked.
