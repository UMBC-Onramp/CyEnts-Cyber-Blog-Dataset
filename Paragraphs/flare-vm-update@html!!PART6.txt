You have successfully installed FLARE VM.
At this point we recommend you power off the VM, switch the VM networking mode to Host-Only, and then take a snapshot to save a clean state of your analysis VM.
Improvement The biggest improvement for FLARE VM is the ability to perform a proper update and uninstallation.
The older version of FLARE VM came as a PowerShell script to install many chocolatey packages, one at a time; therefore, we were unable to include new packages when updating FLARE VM.
In the past, our users had to reinstall FLARE VM completely, which is time consuming, or manually install the new package, which is error prone.
To solve this issue, we have converted FLARE VM itself into a chocolatey package.
Whenever a new tool is available we will also release a new version of FLARE VM.
With this new design we can simply execute “choco upgrade all” to get the newest version of FLARE VM along with any new packages we have released.
