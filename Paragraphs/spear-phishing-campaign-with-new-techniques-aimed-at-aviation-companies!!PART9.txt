The projFUD.dll, available in VirusTotal, is the RAT loader DLL in use.
We observed that a few bytes of the file have been tweaked to avoid hash-based detection.
The description and copyright mentions “VLC MEDIA PLAYER”.
However, the file is not signed.
Although the namespace and class name “ProjFUD.PA” in the loader is same as the one reported in the snip3 campaign, the PDB string retrieved from the loader DLL is different.
