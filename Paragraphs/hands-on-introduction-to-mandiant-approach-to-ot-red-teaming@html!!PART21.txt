Outlook Mandiant's OT red teaming supports organizations by combining both the hands-on analysis of vulnerabilities and weaknesses in IT and OT networks with the conceptual modeling of attacker goals and possible avenues to reach specific outcomes.
It also enables security practitioners to adopt the attacker's perspective and explore attack vectors that may otherwise have not been conceived regardless of their value as low-hanging fruit for OT intrusions.
Our approach presents realistic scenarios based upon technical evidence of intrusion activity upon OT intermediary systems in the tested network.
In this way, it is tailored to support consequence-driven analysis of threats to specific critical systems and processes.
This enables organizations to identify attack scenarios involving digital assets and determine safeguards that can best help to protect the process and ensure the safety of their facilities.
