The threat actors were seen using rclone to exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of data over the SMB protocol to the pCloud cloud-based hosting and storage service.
The threat actor deployed the file power_encryptor.exe in a victim environment, encrypting files and creating ransom notes over the SMB protocol.
Mandiant observed the threat actor navigate to ESXi administration interfaces and disable snapshot features prior to the ransomware encryptor deployment, which affected several VM images.
UNC2465 UNC2465 activity dates back to at least April 2019 and is characterized by their use of similar TTPs to distribute the PowerShell-based .NET
backdoor SMOKEDHAM in victim environments.
In one case where DARKSIDE was deployed, there were months-long gaps, with only intermittent activity between the time of initial compromise to ransomware deployment.
In some cases, this could indicate that initial access was provided by a separate actor.
UNC2465 used phishing emails and legitimate services to deliver the SMOKEDHAM backdoor.
SMOKEDHAM is a .NET backdoor that supports keylogging, taking screenshots, and executing arbitrary .NET commands.
During one incident, the threat actor appeared to establish a line of communication with the victim before sending a malicious Google Drive link delivering an archive containing an LNK downloader.
