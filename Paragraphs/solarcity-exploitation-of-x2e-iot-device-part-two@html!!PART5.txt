We decided to see if this would be possible on the X2e.
These attacks, known as glitch attacks (or more officially known as fault-injection), are a type of side channel attack that attempts to cause a microcontroller unit (MCU) to skip instructions, perform wrong instructions, or fail to access flash memory .
Various types of glitching attacks exist including electrical, thermal, and radiation.
Based on our objective, we opted to try glitching the power between the MCU and the Spansion NAND flash.
Note that glitch attacks can often cause damage to the components on a board or put the device in an unusable state.
These types of attacks should be tested as either a last resort or against a secondary device you are comfortable with damaging.
