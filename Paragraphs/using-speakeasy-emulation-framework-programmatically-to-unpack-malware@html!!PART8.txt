At the start of a handler, it is good practice to include MSDN's documented prototype as a comment (lines 3-8).
The handler's code begins by storing elements of the argv parameter in variables named after their corresponding API parameters (line 9).
The handler's ctx parameter is a dictionary that contains contextual information about the API call.
For API functions that end in an ‘ A ’ or ‘ W ’ (e.g., CreateFileA ), the character width can be retrieved by passing the ctx parameter to the get_char_width function (line 10).
