Over the last few months, FireEye has tracked an in-the-wild campaign that leverages compromised sites to spread fake updates.
In some cases, the payload was the NetSupport Manager remote access tool (RAT).
NetSupport Manager is a commercially available RAT that can be used legitimately by system administrators for remotely accessing client computers.
However, malicious actors are abusing this application by installing it to the victimsâ€™ systems without their knowledge to gain unauthorized access to their machines.
This blog details our analysis of the JavaScript and components used in instances where the identified payload was NetSupport RAT.
