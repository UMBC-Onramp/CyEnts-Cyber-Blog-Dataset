The incident with the mods for Cities: Skylines ended, thankfully, without too much drama.
The malicious developer was banned, and it seems they had no intention of causing serious damage to players.
But they created a rather complex mechanism of penetration users’ computers that exploited peculiarities of the community.
And most importantly, they tried to bring users out from the control of the official platform for distributing mods.
In a worst-case scenario such a backdoor could be used to deliver malicious code that, for example, would steal passwords from the game service or mine cryptocurrency on player’s computer.
Tracking the activity of such “shapeshifter programs” is standard functionality of any reliable security solution.
On top of that our Kaspersky Security Cloud also features a special gaming mode that provides protection with a minimal impact to computer’s performance.
So when experimenting with your favorite game, don’t forget about taking precautions.
