Companies in the IT Hosting and the Freight and Logistics industries have been particularly susceptible to this discrepancy.
Coveware has assisted at least 3 companies that have had to unwind their business when an affordable ransom amount, could not be reached.
Typically, downtime costs are 10x the ransom amount, but in these industries downtime costs can be particularly extreme.
IT Hosting companies are of note as the size and number of their servers can make them appear like a large organization.
Unfortunately, the business of hosting involves high fixed costs, low operating margins, and zero tolerance of downtime by end clients.
  Hosting companies that get attacked typically have a few hours to restore service before their clients drop them for alternatives.
Moreover, these companies suffer irreparable harm to their reputations, and may trigger SLA breaches that leave them exposed to liability.
  
The inability to pay a six-figure ransom has caused multiple hosting companies to shut down.
Freight and Logistics firms are also acutely exposed.
These firms also present like larger firms given the volume of data they move and their network footprint.
Additionally, attacks against Freight and Logistics firms can cause immediate supply chain issues for the victims’ end clients, who are subsequently forced to route through other service providers.
