For mapping their techniques and associated campaigns, we use the MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge model (ATT&CK).
The matrix covers hundreds of techniques, and can be applied for different purposes.
In this case, we will focus on the risk versus mapping the defensive architecture.
In Q1 of 2018, we mapped the targeted attacks discovered by ourselves and our peers in the industry.
The following example comes from one adversary we tracked, showing the techniques they used: With MITREâ€™s Navigator tool you can select an actor or malware family.
After making the selection, the boxes in the matrix show which techniques the actor or malware has used.
From these techniques we can learn how our environments protect against these techniques and where we have gaps.
The goal is not to create coverage or signatures for each technique; the matrix helps organizations understand how attackers behave.
