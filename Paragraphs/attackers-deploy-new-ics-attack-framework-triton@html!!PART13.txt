This sample left legitimate programs in place, expecting the controller to continue operating without a fault or exception.
If the controller failed, TRITON would attempt to return it to a running state.
If the controller did not recover within a defined time window, this sample would overwrite the malicious program with invalid data to cover its tracks.
Recommendations Asset owners who wish to defend against the capabilities demonstrated in the incident, should consider the following controls: Where technically feasible, segregate safety system networks from process control and information system networks.
Engineering workstations capable of programming SIS controllers should not be dual-homed to any other DCS process control or information system network.
Leverage hardware features that provide for physical control of the ability to program safety controllers.
These usually take the form of switches controlled by a physical key.
On Triconex controllers, keys should not be left in the PROGRAM mode other than during scheduled programming events.
Implement change management procedures for changes to key position.
Audit current key state regularly.
