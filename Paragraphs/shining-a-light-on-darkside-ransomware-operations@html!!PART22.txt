Acknowledgements Beyond the comparatively small number of people who are listed as authors on this report are hundreds of consultants, analysts and reverse-engineers who tirelessly put in the work needed to respond to intrusions at breakneck pace and still maintain unbelievably high analytical standards.
This larger group has set the foundation for all of our work, but a smaller group of people contributed more directly to producing this report and we would like to thank them by name.
We would like to specifically thank Bryce Abdo and Matthew Dunwoody from our Advanced Practices team and Jay Smith from FLARE, all of whom provided analytical support and technical review.
Notable support was also provided by Ioana Teaca, and Muhammadumer Khan.
