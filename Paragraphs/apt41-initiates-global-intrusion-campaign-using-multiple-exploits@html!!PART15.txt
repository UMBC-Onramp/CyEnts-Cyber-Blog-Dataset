Outlook This activity is one of the most widespread campaigns we have seen from China-nexus espionage actors in recent years.
While APT41 has previously conducted activity with an extensive initial entry such as the trojanizing of NetSarang software, this scanning and exploitation has focused on a subset of our customers , and seems to reveal a high operational tempo and wide collection requirements for APT41.
It is notable that we have only seen these exploitation attempts leverage publicly available malware such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter.
While these backdoors are full featured, in previous incidents APT41 has waited to deploy more advanced malware until they have fully understood where they were and carried out some initial reconnaissance.
In 2020, APT41 continues to be one of the most prolific threats that FireEye currently tracks.
This new activity from this group shows how resourceful and how quickly they can leverage newly disclosed vulnerabilities to their advantage.
