__main__': url=sys.argv[1] while(1): cmd=input('cmd:')
exploit(url,cmd)
The script contained some hardcoded HTTP header values including user-agent, accepted data types, accepted languages and content-type.
The script builds an HTTP request and allows the user to specify the command they would like to run; it would then append the URL and command to the crafted exploit to execute.
In our instance the attacker was leveraging this vulnerability to launch mshta.exe to download a second stage payload.
Using search engines for internet connected devices such as Shodan or Censys we can quickly identify systems running the Weaver e-cology platform.
Using this technique, we identified 28 internet facing system that are potentially vulnerable.
Conclusion This isn't a new story; Managed Defense responds to cases like this every week.
The usage of FOMB was particularly interesting in this instance and it's the first case in Managed Defense we've seen this technique being leveraged in an attempt to bypass defenses.
 When leveraged correctly, compiled “.bmf”
 files can be effectively used to sneak into an environment undetected and gain a foothold via persistence in the WMI buffer.
