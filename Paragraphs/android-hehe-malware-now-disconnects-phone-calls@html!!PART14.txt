The app uses hxxp://122.10.92.117:9008 and hxxp://58.64.183.12:9008 to send information to the CnC server.
The mapping of URLs to their internal class data structures is as follows:
GetLastVersionRequest /getLastVersion
RegisterRequest /register LoginRequest /login
ReportRequest /report
GetTaskRequest /getTask
ReportMessage Request /reportMessage
The meaning and structures of these are explained in the following sections.
