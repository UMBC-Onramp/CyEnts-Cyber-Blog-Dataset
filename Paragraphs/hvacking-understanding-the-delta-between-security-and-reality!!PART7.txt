The next question was, what do we copy?
Using “/proc/mtd” to gain information about how memory is partitioned, we could see file systems located on mtd4 and mtd5.
We used dd to copy off both the mtd4 and mtd5 partitions.
We later discovered that one of the images is a backup used as a system fall back if a persistent issue is detected.
