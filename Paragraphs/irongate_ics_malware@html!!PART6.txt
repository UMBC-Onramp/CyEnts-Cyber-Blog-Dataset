A Proof of Concept IRONGATE’s characteristics lead us to conclude that it is a test, proof of concept, or research activity.
The code is specifically crafted to look for a user-created DLL communicating with the Siemens PLCSIM environment.
PLCSIM is used to test PLC program functionality prior to in-field deployment.
The DLLs that IRONGATE seeks and replaces are not part of the Siemens standard product set, but communicate with the S7ProSim COM object.
Malware authors test concepts using commercial simulation software.
Code in the malicious software closely matched usage on a control engineering blog dealing with PLCSIM (https://alexsentcha.wordpress.com/using-s7-prosim-with-siemens-s7-plcsim/ and https://pcplcdemos.googlecode.com/hg/S7PROSIM/BioGas/S7%20v5.5/).
While we have identified and analyzed several droppers for the IRONGATE malware, we have yet to identify the code’s infection vector.
