Compared with InMobi’s earlier versions, we consider change No. 1 as an improvement that addresses the aforementioned issue of an attacker making phone calls without a user’s consent.
We are glad to see that InMobi made this change after our notification.
InMobi recently released a new SDK version 4.1.0.

Improving Security for JS Binding in Third-party Libraries In summary, the insecure usage of JS Binding and JS Binding annotations in third-party libraries exposes many apps that contain these libraries to security risks.

We propose the following to the mobile application development and library vendor community: Third-party library vendors need to explicitly disclose security-sensitive features in their privacy policies and/or their app developer SDK guides.
