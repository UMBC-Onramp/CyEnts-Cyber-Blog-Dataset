In other cases, as we described in our second blog , the attacker often uses known post-exploitation frameworks, for privilege escalation, lateral movement and performing any additional actions on their objective.
Since quite a few of these frameworks are readily available we often call this the “GitHubification” of attack tools.
In this case however, the attacker could actually skip this step and continue with the network reconnaissance and deployment of the ransomware immediately, since a high privileged account was already compromised.
Lateral Movement With the administrator-level account, the attacker used SMB to perform network reconnaissance, resulting in an overview of accessible hosts.
Subsequently, the attacker used the internal Microsoft Remote Access Server (RAS) to access these systems using either the administrator or the LocalSystem account.
The LocalSystem account is a built-in Windows account.
It is the most authoritative account on a Windows local instance (more potent than any admin account).
