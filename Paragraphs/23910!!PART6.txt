On a number of occasions, travelers have been able to locate their lost baggage faster than the airline employees could.
But in practice, right after the device went on sale, reports started cropping up about how people used it in ways that were not completely legal, and there were even reports of overt criminal activity.
Here are the major examples.
An activist from Germany uncovered the location of a top-secret state agency after mailing it an envelope containing an AirTag.
A lot of people use such a tactic — which is more or less legal depending on the laws of a country — to track actual mail delivery routes, for example.
But it’s also possible to use an AirTag like the German activist did: if someone uses a PO Box to receive mail so they can keep their real address private, a piece of mail that has an AirTag inside it will reveal the actual place of residence.
