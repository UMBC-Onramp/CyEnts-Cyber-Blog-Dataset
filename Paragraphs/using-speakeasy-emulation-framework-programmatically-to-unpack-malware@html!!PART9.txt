This width value can then be passed to calls such as read_mem_string (lines 12 and 13), which reads the emulatorâ€™s memory at a given address and returns a string.
It is good practice to overwrite string pointer values in the argv parameter with their corresponding string values (lines 14 and 15).
This enables Speakeasy to display string values instead of pointer values in its API logs.
To illustrate the impact of updating argv values, examine the Speakeasy output shown in Figure 7.
