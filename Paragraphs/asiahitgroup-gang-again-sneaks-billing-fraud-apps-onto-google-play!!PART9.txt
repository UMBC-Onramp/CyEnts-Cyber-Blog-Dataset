WAP billing fraud in Malaysia.
However, for Malaysia the app needs to intercept a confirmation code (PIN) sent by the mobile operator via SMS.
Sonvpay has this SMS interception functionality implemented in the original repackaged application: Figure 8.
Processing an intercepted SMS message to get the confirmation PIN.
Once the PIN is obtained, it is sent to the mobile operator via a web request to automatically confirm the subscription.
If the parameters for Kazakhstan or Malaysia do not match, Sonvpay still tries to perform mobile billing fraud by attempting to send an SMS message to a premium-rate number provided via the silent push notification: Figure 9.
