We compare the baseline model, the standard model retrain, the incrementally learned model and the RCOP model.
Figure 3:
Bad churn versus accuracy on test set 2.
Table 1 summarizes each of these approaches, discussed in detail above.

A description of the models tested The baseline model has 100 fewer trees than the other models, which could explain the comparatively reduced accuracy.
However, we tried increasing the number of trees which resulted in only a minor increase in accuracy of < 0.001%.
The increase in accuracy for the non-baseline methods is due to the differences in data set and training methods.
