It also adds a function to parse parameters of received command data.
The script enclosed in the tags ##cgistart2 and ##cgiend2 is responsible for checking web requests designed to be executed by the webshell, if present.
If no webshell request is found, the script passes execution to the legitimate Perl script for the webpage.
The webshell portion of the script is invoked when it receives a form submission name=value pair of serverid matching a secret key.
This causes the webshell to extract the string passed to it via the QUERY_STRING CGI environment variable.
Individual key/value pairs delimited by the & character and are URL decoded.
Although the script parses out all key/value pairs it receives, it specifically looks for and extracts data associated with the cmd parameter.
If found, it will generate a form containing the extracted cmd to be executed and the previous serverid value along with a form submission button named Run .
Upon submission, the webshell will execute the passed command on the victim host's command line and display the results to the attacker before exiting.
