Social media has been a part of our lives for more than a decade.
Recently, nation-states have infamously used social media platforms to spread misinformation.
In 2019, we expect criminals to begin leveraging those tactics for their own gain.
Equally, the continued growth of the Internet of Things in the home will inspire criminals to target those devices for monetary gain.
One thing is certain: Our dependency on technology has become ubiquitous.
Consider the breaches of identity platforms, with reports of 50 million users being affected.
It is no longer the case that a breach is limited to that platform.
Everything is connected, and you are only as strong as your weakest link.
In the future, we face the question of which of our weakest links will be compromised.
