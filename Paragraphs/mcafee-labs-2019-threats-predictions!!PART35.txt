The increase in interest was primarily in relation to ICS, consumer, medical, and “smart city” verticals.
(See Figure 1.)
Smart edge devices, combined with high-speed connectivity, are enabling IoT ecosystems, but the rate at which they are advancing is compromising the security of these systems.
Figure 1:
The number of conference sessions on the security of IoT devices has increased, matching the growing threat to poorly protected devices.
Most IoT edge devices provide no self-defense (isolating critical functions, memory protection, firmware protection, least privileges, or security by default) so one successful exploit owns the device.
IoT edge devices also suffer from “break once, run everywhere” attacks—due to insecure components used across many device types and verticals.
(See articles on WingOS and reverse engineering.)
McAfee Advanced Threat Research team engineers have demonstrated how medical device protocols can be exploited to endanger human life and compromise patients’ privacy due to assumed trust.
These examples illustrate just a few of many possible scenarios that lead us to believe adversaries will choose IoT edge devices as the path of least resistance to achieve their objectives.
Servers have been hardened over the last decade, but IoT hardware is far behind.
By understanding an adversary’s motives and opportunities (attack surface and access capability), we can define a set of security requirements independent of a specific attack vector.
