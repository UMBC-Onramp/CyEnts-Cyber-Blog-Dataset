If attaching to nsiproxy.sys fails, the rootkit attaches to \\Device\\Tcp instead, intercepting IOCTL_TCP_QUERY_INFORMATION_EX (0x120003) and hiding network connections in a similar manner.
By default, the global network list is initialized with the following process paths: *\\SYN.EXE *\\SVCHOST.EXE
As a result, TCP connections of all services running under svchost.exe are hidden, not just the ones of the Milestone backdoor.
Attribution The Milestone backdoor is actually the same Infoadmin RAT that was used by Deep Panda back in the early 2010s, referenced in blogs from 2013 and 2015 .
Although many backdoors are based on Gh0st RAT code, Milestone and Infoadmin are distinguishable from the rest.
Besides having profoundly similar code, both backdoors incorporate identical modifications of Gh0st RAT code not seen in other variants.
