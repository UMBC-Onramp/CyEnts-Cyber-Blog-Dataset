Paste.nrecom has been in service since May 2014.
If you are not familiar with pastebin, it is a service where you can post your code or text data with the intent of sharing it with others.
Paste.nrecom does the same thing and it also offers an API that allows scripting.
This is advantageous to threat actors as they can easily insert and update data programmatically.
This service is powered by Stikked , which is an open-source PHP based pastebin.
How do threat actors use it for malicious purposes?
Because it is a text-only service, one would think that it cannot host an executable file (binary data) into it.
However, binary data can be represented as a text file by simply encoding it.
The common encoding method is using base64 .
That is exactly what the threat actors did in this case.
malicious paste encoded in base64 To add another layer of obfuscation, they encrypt the binary data with a XOR key.
The following file, for example, is encrypted with XOR key, 0x02.
After base64 decoding, the file is still encrypted with XOR algorithm.
After all the necessary decoding and decryption, you will then see the executable file, as shown above.
