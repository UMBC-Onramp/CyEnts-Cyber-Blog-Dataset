Initial Analysis and Physical Inspection Network Reconnaissance We started our research by assessing the X2e device from a network perspective.
By using nmap , we discovered that the device exposed both SSH and HTTP/HTTPS, shown in Figure 3.

We also performed limited brute force attempts, which were unsuccessful.
Additionally, the underlying services were not vulnerable to any public exploits.
