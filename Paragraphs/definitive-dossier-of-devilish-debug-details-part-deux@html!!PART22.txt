However, while our recall (the percentage of bad things we could identify with the model) was relatively high at 89%, our malware precision (the share of those things we called bad that were actually bad) was far too low, hovering at or below 50%.
This indicates that using this model alone for malware detection would result in an unacceptably large number of false positives, were we to deploy it in the wild as a singular detection platform.
However, used in conjunction with other tools, this could be a useful weak signal to assist with analysis.
Conclusion and Next Steps While our journey of statistical PDB analysis did not yield a magic malware classifier, it did yield a number of useful findings that we were hoping for: We developed several file path feature functions which are transferable to other models under development.
By diving into statistical analysis of the dataset, we were able to identify new keywords and logic branches to include in YARA signatures.
