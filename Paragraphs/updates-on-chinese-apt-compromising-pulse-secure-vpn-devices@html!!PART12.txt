When their operations on the system were finished, the actors disabled SSH on the ESXi host again and cleared or preemptively disabled all relevant logging associated with the performed activities.
This includes authentication, command history, and message logging on the system.
Maintain Presence Mandiant observed the threat actor maintain persistence by compromising the upgrade process on the Pulse Secure Appliance.
  Persistence was primarily achieved by modifying the legitimate DSUpgrade.pm file to install the ATRIUM webshell across each upgrade performed by an administrator.
  
The actor likely chose DSUpgade.pm to host their patch logic as it is a core file in the system upgrade procedure, ensuring the patch is applied during updates.
The patcher modifies content in /tmp/data as this directory holds the extracted upgrade image the newly upgraded system will boot into.
This results in a persistence mechanism which allows the actor to maintain access to the system across updates.
The actors also achieved persistence in other cases by prepending a bash script to the file /bin/
umount normally used to unmount a Linux filesystem.
