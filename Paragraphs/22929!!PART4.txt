An ICO that never happened FOMO is at the heart of many scams.
Lately, for example, we’ve been seeing mass messaging to members of cryptocurrency communities in Discord, with emoji-rich text advertising a new round of an uncapped ICO allegedly being held by a (real) leading-edge blockchain startup — Mina in our example, but there are others as well.
Just like every other fraud scheme, this one tries to rush potential victims into following a link to the “official” website.
Incidentally, the real Mina did hold a placement not long ago, in the randomized queue format, and many who registered got no coins.
The new scheme exploits that history.
