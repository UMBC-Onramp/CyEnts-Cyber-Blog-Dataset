The backdoor also determines if the system is joined to an Active Directory (AD) domain and, if so, retrieves the domain name.
Execution ceases if the system is not joined to an AD domain.
SUNBURST checks the AD domain name against a blocklist and halts execution if it contains one of the following values: swdev.local emea.sales pci.local apac.lab swdev.dmz cork.lab saas.swi dmz.local lab.local dev.local lab.rio lab.brno lab.na test solarwinds
We suspect these hard-coded AD domains may be SolarWinds internal domains that UNC2452 wanted to avoid.
Finally, SUNBURST verifies the system has internet connectivity by ensuring it can resolve the DNS name api.solarwinds.com .
