Taking a deeper inspection of the server we see that it contains an open directory that is public.
In the folder where csrsc.exe resides, a directory timestamp appears to have been changed to look like it is one of the original files from 2016.

We have also observed older campaigns over the past several years being downloaded from this same IP address.
Some of these campaigns involve serving fake data recovery software as well as PayPal themed phishing sites.
However, it is difficult to determine if these attackers are all related, or if this is simply a leased server used by multiple threat actors.
A passive DNS entry of domains that resolved to this IP address highlights a variety of businesses entities, but overall, they appear to be a random collection of websites of customers belonging to the webhosting reseller.
