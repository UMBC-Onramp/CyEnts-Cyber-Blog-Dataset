From here, the powerful facilities of WinDbg are available to debug and analyze the code’s behavior.
Building It Yourself To try out FLARE’s kernel shellcode loader for yourself, you’ll need to download the source code .
To get started building it, download and install the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) .
I’m using Windows Driver Kit Version 7.1.0 , which is command line driven, whereas more modern versions of the WDK integrate with Visual Studio.
If you feel comfortable using a newer kit, you’re welcomed to do so, but beware, you’ll have to take matters into your own hands regarding build commands and dependencies.
Since WDK 7.1.0 is adequate for purposes of this tool, that is the version I will describe in this post.
