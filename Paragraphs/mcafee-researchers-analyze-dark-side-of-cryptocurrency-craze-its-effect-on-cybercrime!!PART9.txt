Silk Road closed:
The popular black market and first major modern cryptocurrency “dark net” market was shut down by the FBI.
The market was tailored to drug sales, and the FBI takedown left its buyers and sellers without a place to sell their goods.
The migration of buyers and sellers to less restrictive markets enabled cross-sales to a much larger audience than was previously available to cybercriminals.
Buyers of drugs could now also buy stolen data—including Netflix accounts or credit cards—from new markets such as AlphaBay as demand increased.
