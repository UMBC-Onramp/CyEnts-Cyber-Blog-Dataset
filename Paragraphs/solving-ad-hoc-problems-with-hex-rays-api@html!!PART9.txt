The Hex-Rays SDK includes a sample, sample5, which can be used to view the current functionâ€™s ctree.
The amount of data shown in a ctree for a function can be overwhelming.
A modified version of the sample was used to produce a picture of a sub-ctree for the function shown in Figure 1.
The sub-ctree for the single expression: 'dword_1000B2D8 =
(int)GetProcAdress(v0, \"CreateThread\");' is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2:
Sub-ctree for GetProcAddress assignment With knowledge of the sub-ctree in use, we can write a script to automatically rename all the global variables that are being assigned using this method.
The code to automatically rename all the local variables is shown in Figure 3.
The code works by traversing the ctree looking for calls to the GetProcAddress function.
Once found, the code takes the name of the function being resolved and finds the global variable that is being set.
The code then uses the IDA MakeName API to rename the address to the correct function.
Figure 3:
Function renaming global variables After the script has been executed, we can see in Figure 4 that all the global variables have been renamed to the appropriate function name.
