A further three large financial institutions in Turkey were victims of this attack.
The implant has so far not surfaced in any other sector or country.
This campaign suggests the attackers may plan a future heist against these targets by using Bankshot to gather information.
Bankshot implants are distributed from a domain with a name similar to that of the cryptocurrency-lending platform Falcon Coin, but the similarly named domain is not associated with the legitimate entity.
The malicious domain falcancoin.io was created December 27, 2017, and was updated on February 19, only a few days before the implants began to appear.
These implants are variations of earlier forms of Bankshot, a remote access tool that gives an attacker full capability on a victimâ€™s system.
This implant also contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase evidence or perform other destructive actions.
