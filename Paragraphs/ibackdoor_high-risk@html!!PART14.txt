FireEye Protection
Immediately after we discovered the high-risk ad library and affected apps, FireEye updated detection rules in its NX and Mobile Threat Prevention (MTP) products to detect the affected apps and their network activities.
In addition, FireEye customers can access the full list of affected apps upon request.
FireEye NX customers are alerted if an employee uses an infected app while their iOS device is connected to the corporate network.
It is important to note that, even if the servers that the backdoored mobiSage SDK communicates with do not deliver JavaScript code that triggers the high-risk backdoors, the affected apps still try to connect to them using HTTP.
This HTTP session is vulnerable to hijacking by outside attackers.
FireEye MTP management customers have full visibility into high-risk apps installed on mobile devices in their deployment base.
End users receive on-device notifications of the detection and IT administrators receive email alerts.
