FireEye Labs recently found a more advanced variant of Android.
MisoSMS, the SMS-stealing malware that we uncovered last December — yet another sign of cybercriminals’ growing interest in hijacking mobile devices for surveillance and data theft.
Like the original version of the malware, the new variant sends copies of users’ text messages to servers in China.
But the newest rendition adds a few features that make it harder to detect, including a new disguise, encrypted transmissions, and command-and-control (CnC) communications that are handled natively rather than over email.
FireEye Mobile Threat Prevention customers are already protected from both variants.
Both variants of MisoSMS use the same names for receivers and services.
While the old variant masquerades as an Android settings application, the new version presents itself as “Gplay Dsc” to the user.
