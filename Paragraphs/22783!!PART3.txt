What makes smishing more dangerous than typical phishing Most of us have more or less gotten used to e-mail phishing, and people by and large know how to recognize and avoid it.
Text messages are a more unexpected channel for scams, so people are less likely to think a short message will represent a scam.
Beyond that, although people trust text messages more, texts tend to be less secure than e-mail.
Nowadays, every halfway decent e-mail service has an intelligent built-in spam filter.
The filters aren’t perfect, but scammers need to keep inventing new moves to get past them.
Unfortunately, when it comes to flexibility and accuracy, mobile operators’ spam filters leave something to be desired.
People also typically read their text messages on the go or between other tasks.
That, combined with a lowered expectation of danger in text messages, means they tend to look less closely at text messages, making an attack more likely to succeed.
