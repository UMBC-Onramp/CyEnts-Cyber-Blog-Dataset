We realize life without iMessage may be very difficult for some (more on that later), but if Pegasus and other high-end APT mobile malware is in your threat model, this is a tradeoff worth taking.
Disable Facetime.
Same advice as above.
Keep the mobile device up to date; install the latest iOS patches as soon as they are out.
Not everyone can afford zero-click 0-day’s, actually many of the iOS exploit kits we are seeing are targeting already patched vulnerabilities.
Nevertheless, many people run older phones and postpone updates for various reasons.
If you want to be ahead of (at least some) nation state hackers, update as soon as possible and teach yourself not to need Emojis to install the patches .
Don’t ever click on links received in messages.
This is simple advice yet effective.
Not all Pegasus customers can afford to buy zero-click 0-day chains at a cost of millions so they rely on 1-click exploits.
