This spear phish contained an attachment that dropped “Malaysian Airlines MH370 5m Video.exe” (MD5: b869dc959daac3458b6a81bc006e5b97).
The malware sample was crafted to appear as though it was a Flash video, by binding a Flash icon to the malicious executable.
Interestingly, in this case, the malware sets its persistence in the normal “Run” registry location, but it tries to auto start the payload from the disk directory “c:\\programdata”, which doesn’t exist until Windows 7, so a simple reboot would mitigate this threat on Windows XP.
This suggests the threat actors did not perform quality control on the malware or were simply careless.
