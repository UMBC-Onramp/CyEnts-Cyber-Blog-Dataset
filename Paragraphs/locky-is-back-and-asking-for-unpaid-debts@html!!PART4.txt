Locky Payload Updates The Locky ransomware downloaded in this campaign requires a command line argument to properly execute.
This command line parameter, “123” in the analyzed sample, is passed to the binary by the first stage JavaScript-based downloader.
This command line parameter value is used in the code unpacking stage of the ransomware.
Legitimate binaries typically verify the number of arguments passed or compare the command line parameter with the expected value and gracefully exit if the check fails.
