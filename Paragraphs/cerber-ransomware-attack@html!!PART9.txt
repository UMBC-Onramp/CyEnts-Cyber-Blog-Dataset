   Interface provided to the victim to pay ransom supports 12 languages Encryption Cerber targets 294 different file extensions for encryption, including .doc
(typically Microsoft Word documents), .ppt
(generally Microsoft PowerPoint slideshows), .jpg and other images.
It also targets financial file formats such as.
ibank (used with certain personal finance management software) and .wallet (used for Bitcoin).
Selective Targeting Selective targeting was used in this campaign.
The attackers were observed checking the country code of a host machine’s public IP address against a list of blacklisted countries in the JSON configuration, utilizing online services such as ipinfo.io to verify the information.
Blacklisted (protected) countries include: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan .
The attack also checked a system's keyboard layout to further ensure it avoided infecting machines in the attackers geography: 1049—Russian, ¨ 1058—Ukrainian, 1059—Belarusian, 1064—Tajik, 1067—Armenian, 1068—Azeri, (Latin), 1079—Georgian, 1087—Kazakh, 1088—Kyrgyz (Cyrillic), 1090—Turkmen, 1091—Uzbek (Latin), 2072—Romanian (Moldova), 2073—Russian (Moldova), 2092—Azeri (Cyrillic), 2115—Uzbek (Cyrillic).
Selective targeting has historically been used to keep malware from infecting endpoints within the author’s geographical region, thus protecting them from the wrath of local authorities.
The actor also controls their exposure using this technique.
In this case, there is reason to suspect the attackers are based in Russia or the surrounding region.
