This command does not exist in the original Gh0st RAT source code.
Among the many backdoor samples we hunted down, there are two distinguishable versions: binaries compiled in 2016 contain the version string MileStone2016 , while those compiled in 2017 contain MileStone2017 .
The samples used in the recent infections we detected are only the 2017 variants.
There are several differences between the 2016 and 2017 Milestones.
First, 2017 Milestones are typically packed with Themida, while 2016 ones are unpacked.
Secondly, although 2016 Milestones have plausible timestamps, all 2017 Milestones share an identical timestamp, which leads us to believe they are forged.
Combined with the fact that 2017 backdoors are used in attacks to this day, it is uncertain whether they were compiled in 2017 or much later.
