Cryptojacking Spam Campaigns FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has observed several cryptocurrency miners distributed via spam campaigns, which is a commonly used tactic to indiscriminately distribute malware.
We expect malicious actors will continue to use this method to disseminate cryptojacking code as for long as cryptocurrency mining remains profitable.
In late November 2017, FireEye researchers identified a spam campaign delivering a malicious PDF attachment designed to appear as a legitimate invoice from the largest port and container service in New Zealand: Lyttelton Port of Chistchurch (Figure 9).
Once opened, the PDF would launch a PowerShell script that downloaded a Monero miner from a remote host.
The malicious miner connected to the pools supportxmr.com and nanopool.org.

Sample lure attachment (PDF) that downloads malicious cryptocurrency miner Additionally, a massive cryptojacking spam campaign was discovered by FireEye researchers during January 2018 that was designed to look like legitimate financial services-related emails.
The spam email directed victims to an infection link that ultimately dropped a malicious ZIP file onto the victim's machine.
Contained within the ZIP file was a cryptocurrency miner utility (MD5: 80b8a2d705d5b21718a6e6efe531d493) configured to mine Monero and connect to the minergate.com pool.
While each of the spam email lures and associated ZIP filenames were different, the same cryptocurrency miner sample was dropped across all observed instances (Table 2).
