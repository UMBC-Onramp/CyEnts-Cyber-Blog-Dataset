Similarities between this variant and the original malware sample: Service name is the same: COMSysApp
The DLL and ini files contain the same functions as described elsewhere in this post Data Reconnaissance
The following information is gathered from the endpoint and sent to the control server.
System info: Computer name System info using: cmd /c systeminfo >%temp%\\temp.ini List of currently running process using: cmd /c tasklist >%temp%\\temp.ini
Exfiltration The data exfiltration process runs in the following sequence: The temp.ini files are copied into a text file that matches the pattern: From <COMPUTER-NAME> (<Month>-<Day> <Hour>-<Minute>-<Second>).txt.
For example, From <COMPUTER-NAME> (01-04 11-40-02).txt
All the text files are now packed into the archive temp.zip (%temp%\\temp.zip) zip is Base64 encoded (with a custom key, same as that used in the malicious document) and then copied to post.txt txt is uploaded to the control server Additional Commands and Capabilities The service-based DLL implant traverses to the /htdocs/ directory on the FTP server and looks for any files with the keywords: TO EVERYONE:
Commands issued to all infected endpoints TO <COMPUTERNAME>: Commands issued to endpoints matching the ComputerName
