The first stage payload downloaded from these URLs consisted of a Zip compressed file containing a corrupt decoy PDF document and a heavily obfuscated JavaScript downloader.
Mandiant tracks the downloader as DOUBLEDRAG.
Interestingly, the PDF documents were obtained from public websites, but corrupted by removing bytes to render them unreadable with a standard PDF viewer.
It is speculated that the victim would then attempt to launch the JavaScript (.js) file, which can be executed natively with Windows Script Host by simply double clicking on the file.
