Descriptions added to the constant enumeration members Preparing the MSDN database file The plug-inâ€™s graphical interface requires you to have the QT framework and Python scripting installed.
This is included with the IDA Pro 6.6 release.
You can also set it up for IDA 6.5 as described here ( http://www.hexblog.com/?p=333 ).
As mentioned earlier, the plug-in requires an XML database file storing the MSDN documentation.
We cannot distribute the database file with the plug-in because Microsoft holds the copyright for it.
However, we provide a script to generate the database file.
It can be cloned from the git repository at https://github.com/fireeye/flare-ida together with the annotation plug-in.
