To obtain the answer you want from Cortana, you may have to combine both approaches.
For example, we asked “Hey Cortana, what is Miss Aruba?”
We saw, while the device was locked, the following answer: The official website link points to “hxxp://www.missaruba.aw.”
A quick search shows the domain is still available.
In conclusion, we now have Wikipedia articles for which Cortana will display an official website link, and for which the domain is available for purchase.
After spending $11.99 for a cheaper domain, we own one.
Although it took some regular-expression authoring, some scripting, and buying a domain, this method was faster and more satisfying than waiting for Bing to publish and index a new Wikipedia entry.
