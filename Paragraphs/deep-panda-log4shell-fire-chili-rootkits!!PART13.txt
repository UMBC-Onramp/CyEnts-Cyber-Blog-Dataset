If so, the process is removed from the ActiveProcessLinks list of the EPROCESS structure, which is a circular doubly-linked list of all running processes on the system.
The driver removes the process’s list entry from ActiveProcessLinks ​​​​​​​by linking its Flink (the next entry) to its Blink (the previous entry).
As a result, the process is hidden from utilities such as Task Manager.
Since the EPROCESS structure changes between Windows builds, the rootkit resolves the ActiveProcessLinks offset dynamically during runtime.
It traverses the process’s EPROCESS ​​​​​​​structure, comparing each member to its PID, to locate the offset of the UniqueProcessId field.
