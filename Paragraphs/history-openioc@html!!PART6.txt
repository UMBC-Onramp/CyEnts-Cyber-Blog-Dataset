The version we released in 2011 as \"1.0\" had already been revised and improved upon internally several times before its Open Source debut.
We continue to update the standard as needed, allowing for features and requests that we have received over time from other users or interested parties.
Unlike traditional \"signatures,\" OpenIOC provides the ability to use logical comparison of Indicators in an IOC, providing more flexibility and discrimination than simple lists of artifacts.
