Listing 4: InitNamedColorProfileData decompiled Here the code tries to read the ‘ncl2’ tag/element and get the size of the stream from file.
A buffer is allocated and the same call is made once again to read the complete content of the element ‘ncl2’.
This buffer is parsed to find the count and number of device coordinates, and the values are verified by making sure read/write ends up with in the buffer size.
