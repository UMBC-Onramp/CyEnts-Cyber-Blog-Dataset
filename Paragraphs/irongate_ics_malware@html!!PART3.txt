This malicious DLL records five seconds of 'normal' traffic from a PLC to the user interface and replays it, while sending different data back to the PLC.
This could allow an attacker to alter a controlled process unbeknownst to process operators.
Sandbox Evasion IRONGATE's second notable feature involves sandbox evasion.
Some droppers for the IRONGATE malware would not run if VMware or Cuckoo Sandbox environments were employed.
The malware uses these techniques to avoid detection and resist analysis, and developing these anti-sandbox techniques indicates that the author wanted the code to resist casual analysis attempts.
