For the sample analyzed, the configuration filename is “config.dat.tmp”.
The configuration data is Base64 encoded and AES-256 encrypted using the following key:
hz8l2fnpvp71ujfy8rht6b0smouvp9k8 The configuration has the following example values when Base64 decoded and AES decrypted: 48b9e25491e088a35105274cae0b9e67|5-15|0|0|TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NDsgcnY6NzUuMCkgR2V ja28vMjAxMDAxMDEgRmlyZWZveC83NS4w The configuration holds several values delimited by a “|” character, which are briefly described as follows.
48b9e25491e088a35105274cae0b9e67 MD5 hash of the current timestamp calculated during execution.
