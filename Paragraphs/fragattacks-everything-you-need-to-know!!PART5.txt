Threat actors could also intercept a device ownerâ€™s information by tricking the client into using a malicious DNS server.
Or, they could bypass the NAT firewall, giving the attacker potential access to devices connected to the Wi-Fi network.
Multiple Types of Attack The flaws enable three different types of attack: An aggregation attack exploits the frame aggregation feature of Wi-Fi.
In this attack, the threat actor tricks a victim into changing the setting on specific packets.
This allows the attacker to intercept traffic by making it use a malicious DNS server.
A mixed key attack exploits the fact that the fragmentation feature of Wi-Fi assumes broken-up packets are encrypted using the same key as the larger original packet.
By mixing fragments encrypted with different keys, attackers can exfiltrate data from the network.
And the third enables a fragment cache attack.
This exploits non-reassembled fragments left in memory and involves injecting a malicious fragment in the fragment cache of the targeted access point.
When a victim connects and sends a fragmented frame, it can be reassembled with the malicious fragments.
