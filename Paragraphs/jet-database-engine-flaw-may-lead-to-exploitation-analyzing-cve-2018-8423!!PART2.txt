The flaw allows an attacker to execute code to escalate privileges or to download malware.
We do not know if the vulnerability is used in any attacks; however, the proof of concept code is widely available.
Overview To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to use social engineering techniques to convince a victim to open a JavaScript file which uses an ADODB connection object to access a malicious Jet Database file.
Once the malicious Jet database file is accessed, it calls the vulnerable function in msrd3x40.dll which can lead to exploitation of this vulnerability.
Although the available proof of concept causes a crash in wscript.exe, any application using this DLL is susceptible to the attack.
The following error message indicates the vulnerability was successfully triggered: The message shows an access violation occurred in the vulnerable DLL.
This vulnerability is an “out-of-bounds write ,” which can be triggered via OLE DB, the API used to access data in many Microsoft applications.
