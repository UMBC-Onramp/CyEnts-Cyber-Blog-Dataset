It consists of an app for Windows, macOS, or Ubuntu and the prnt.sc cloud portal and lets users share screenshots quickly and easily: One click or shortcut sends an image to the cloud and returns an URL for sharing.
Anyone can see published screenshots without authentication ; you don’t even need a Lightshot account.
That makes the service fast and convenient but not very secure.
Moreover, to view a screenshot, you don’t even need the exact link; the URLs are sequential, so if you replace a character in one of them with the next in order, for example, another image will open.
