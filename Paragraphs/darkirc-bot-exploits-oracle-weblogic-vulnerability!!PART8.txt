We found an account in Hack Forums by the name of “Freak_OG” that advertised this botnet back in August 2020 for $75USD.
Threat actor advertising on hack forums.
On November 1, the same account posted a FUD (Fully Undetected) Crypter, selling it for $25USD.
The filename of the file he is showing in this post resembles the “Application Name” of our payload, WindowsFormsApp2.exe.
Threat actor advertising it’s crypter We are not certain if the bot operator who attacked our honeypot is the same person who is advertising this malware in Hack Forums or one of his/her customers.
Conclusion Threat actors will always be on the hunt for victims.
One of the fastest ways for them to be victimized is to use a zero day exploit and attack the internet, usually via a spray-and-pray technique.
This vulnerability was fixed by Oracle in October and a subsequent out of cycle patch was also released in November to fix a hole in the previous patch.
