The volume of threats related to COVID-19 has been significant, with lures used in all manner of attacks.
Tracking these campaigns reveals the most targeted sector is healthcare, followed by finance, and then education.
Mobile Threats In March 2020 alone, McAfee Labs identified several malicious Android applications abusing keywords connected to the pandemic.
The apps range from ransomware samples to spy-agents that spy on the victim’s device.
For example, statically analyzing an app called “Corona Safety Mask,” we observe that the amount of permissions is suspicious: Full Internet access that allows the app to create network sockets Read contact data from the victim’s device Send SMS messages When the user downloads the app, it can order a facemask from the following site: “ coronasafetymask.tk. ”
The SMS send permission is abused to send the scam to the victim’s contact list.
Although attribution will clearly be a key concern it is not the primary focus of our research, however there appears to be APT groups incorporating  the COVID-19 theme into their campaigns.
For example, spreading documents that talk about the pandemic and are weaponized with malicious macro-code to download malware to the victim’s system.
