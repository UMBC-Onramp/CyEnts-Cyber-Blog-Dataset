High-Level Analysis of the Payload The final payload was identified by FireEye Intelligence as a NETWIRE backdoor.
The backdoor receives commands from a command and control (C2) server, performs reconnaissance that includes the collection of user data, and returns the information to the C2 server.
Capabilities of the NETWIRE backdoor include key logging, reverse shell, and password theft.
The backdoor uses a custom encryption algorithm to encrypt data and then writes it to a file created in the ./LOGS directory.
The malware also contains a custom obfuscation algorithm to hide registry keys, APIs, DLL names, and other strings from static analysis.
Figure 10 provides the decompiled version of the custom decoding algorithm used on these strings.
