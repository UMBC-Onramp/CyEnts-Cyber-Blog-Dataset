This gave us enough information about the dataset without blowing up our model with too many features (and therefore, dimensions).
One-hot encoding the presence of these terms was then the final step in featurizing the directory names present in the paths.
YARA Signatures Do Grow on Trees Armed with some statistical features, as well as one-hot encoded keyword matches, we began to train some models on our now-featurized dataset.
In doing so, we hoped to use the model training and evaluation process to give us insights into how to build better signatures.
If we developed an effective classification model, that would be an added benefit.
We felt that tree-based models made sense for this use case for two reasons.
First, tree-based models have worked well in the past in domains requiring a certain amount of interpretability and using a blend of quantitative and categorical features.
Second, the features we used are largely things we could represent in a YARA signature.
Therefore, if our models built boolean logic branches that separated large numbers of PDB files, we could potentially translate these into signatures.
