First, FakeNet-NG does not yet support conditional redirection of specific processes, hosts, or ports on Linux.
This means that settings like ProcessWhiteList will not work as expected.
We plan to add support for these settings in a later release.
In the meantime, SingleHost mode supports redirecting all Internet-bound traffic to local listeners, which is the main use case for malware analysts.
Second, the python-netfilterqueue library is hard-coded to handle datagrams of no more than 4,012 octets in length.
Loopback interfaces are commonly configured with high maximum transmittal unit (MTU) settings that allow certain applications to exceed this hard-coded limit, resulting in unanticipated network behavior.
An example of a network application that may exhibit issues due to this would be a large file transfer via FTP.
A workaround is to recompile python-netfilterqueue with a larger buffer size or to decrease the MTU for the loopback interface (i.e. lo) to 4,012 or less.
Configuring FakeNet-NG on Linux In addition to the new NetworkMode setting, Linux support for FakeNet-NG introduces the following Linux-specific configuration items:
LinuxRedirectNonlocal : For MultiHost mode, this setting specifies a comma-delimited list of network interfaces for which to redirect all traffic to the local host so that FakeNet-NG can reply to it.
