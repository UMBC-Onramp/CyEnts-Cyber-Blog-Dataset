As we predicted in last weekâ€™s post , threat actors continue to utilize new Realtek vulnerabilities disclosed by IoT Inspector Research Lab to distribute malware.
Starting on August 19 th , Juniper Threat Labs observed a new set of attacks in the wild on IoT firmware built with the Realtek SDK, this time targeting CVE-2021-35395, which was just disclosed on August 16 by IoT Inspector.
