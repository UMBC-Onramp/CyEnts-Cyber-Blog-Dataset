We could also see the fuzzer recognized the max acceptable size for the BACnet application layer as only 1476 bytes.
Additional testing showed that sending only this packet did not produce the same results; only when all 97 packets were sent did the crash occur.
Analyzing the Crash Since the system provides a core dump upon crashing, it was logical to analyze it for further information.
From the core dump (reproduced in Figure 7), we could see the device encountered a segmentation fault .
We also saw that register R0 contained what looked like data copied from our malformed packet, along with the backtrace being potentially corrupted.

The core dump also provided us the precise location of the crash.
Using the memory map from the device, it was possible to determine that address 0x4026e580 is located in memcpy .
Since the device does not deploy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), the memory address did not change throughout our testing.
