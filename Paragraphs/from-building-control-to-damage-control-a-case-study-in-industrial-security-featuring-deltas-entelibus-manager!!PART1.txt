Control.
It seems that you can’t stick five people in a room together without one of them trying to order the others around.
This tendency towards centralized authority is not without reason, however – it is often more efficient to have one person, or thing, calling the shots.
For an example of the latter, one needs look no further than Delta’s enteliBUS Manager, or eBMGR.
Put simply, this device aims to centralize control for various pieces of hardware often found in corporate or industrial settings, whether it be temperature and humidity controls for a server room, a boiler and its corresponding alarms and sensors in a factory, or access control and lighting in a business.
The advantages seem obvious, too – it can be configured to adjust fan speeds according to thermostat readings or sound an alarm if pressure crosses a certain threshold, all with little human interaction.
