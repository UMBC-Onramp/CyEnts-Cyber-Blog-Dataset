MISP import events into FIN11 event MISP allows for a streamlined way to drill and tag indicators as well as enrich and pivot with threat intelligence.
We can also choose to perform this enrichment process within MISP using a variety of open intelligence sources and their modules, such as Mandiant Advantage , PassiveTotal , Shodan and VirusTotal .
We can also achieve the same result using similar tools already packaged in ThreatPursuit VM.
Using Maltego CE, installed as part of the VM, we can automate aspects of targeted collection and analysis of our FIN11 malware families and associated infrastructure.
