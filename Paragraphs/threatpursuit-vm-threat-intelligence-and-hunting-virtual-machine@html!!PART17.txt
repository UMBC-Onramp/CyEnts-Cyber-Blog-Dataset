AppAnyRun Execution Report on 3c43d080b5badfdde7aff732c066d1b2 We now have a confident signature hit, but with different named detections on the malware family.
This is a common challenge for threat analysts and researchers.
However we have gained interesting information about the malware itself such as its execution behavior, encryption methods, dropped files, timelines and command and control server and beacon information.
This is more than enough for us to pivot across our own datasets to hunt for previously seen activities and prepare to finalize our report.
Once we are confident in our analysis, we can start to model and attribute the malware characteristics.
We can leverage other threat exchange communities and intelligence sources to further enrich the information we collected on the sample.
Enrichment allows the analysts to greater extrapolate context such as timings, malware similarity, associated infrastructures, and prior targeting information.
