The acquisition gateway also often acts as the server connecting to the hospitalâ€™s information system (using the HL7 protocol) to enrich images with patient data.
The PACS controller is the central unit coordinating all traffic among the different components.
The final component in the PACS infrastructure is the database and archiving system.
The system ensures that all images are correctly stored and labeled for either short- or long-term storage.
Larger implementations might have multiple imaging devices and acquisition gateways in various locations, connected over the Internet.
