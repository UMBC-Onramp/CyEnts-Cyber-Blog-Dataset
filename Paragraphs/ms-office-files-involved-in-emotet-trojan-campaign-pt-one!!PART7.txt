It then calls ExitProcess() to exit the first “rundll32.exe”.
In Figure 3.2 it is about to call the API CreateProcessW() to run the new command.
When Emotet is running with the “DllRegisterServer” export function, it will normally exit from X.dll’s EntryPoint() as well as puihoud.dll’s EntryPoint() (step 3 in Figure 3.3).
Next, rundll32 calls the API GetProcAddress() to gather the export function “DllRegisterServer” from “puihoud.dll” and call it.
