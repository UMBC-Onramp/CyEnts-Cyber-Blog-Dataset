This time, the software update was Kaseya’s VSA remote management tool, which was poisoned with malicious code that launched a chain of events ending with an infection by the group’s ransomware.
Some portion of REvil actors are believed to be based in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe.
The gang opened with a $70M ransom demand and later lowered it to $50M for the release of a decryptor that would apply to all the affected victims.
How Did Attackers Get in?
Threat actors affiliated with REvil ransomware were able to leverage a zero-day file upload and code injection vulnerability in Kaseya VSA’s on-prem solution.
What’s been reported as CVE-2021-30116 was the security vulnerability the attackers exploited for their initial foothold.
This flaw allowed for an authentication bypass and for executing arbitrary commands, which later helped attackers download and distribute a malicious loader masquerading as a VSA update to victim systems with VSA agents installed.
