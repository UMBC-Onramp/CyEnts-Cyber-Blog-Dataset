When a user upgrades to capa 2.0, they’ll see that the tool runs faster and provides more precise results.
Signature Generation To provide the benefits of python-flirt to all users (especially those without an IDA Pro license) we have spent significant time to create a comprehensive FLIRT signature set for the common malware analysis use-case.
The signatures come included with capa and are also available at our GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.
We believe that other projects can benefit greatly from this.
For example, we expect the performance of FLOSS to improve once we’ve incorporated library function identification.
Moreover, you can use our signatures with IDA Pro to recognize more library code.
Our initial signatures include: From Microsoft Visual Studio (VS), for all major versions from VS6 to VS2019: C and C++ run-time libraries Active Template Library (ATL) and Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) libraries
The following open-source projects as compiled with VS2015, VS2017, and VS2019:
CryptoPP curl Microsoft Detours Mbed TLS (previously PolarSSL) OpenSSL zlib Identifying and collecting the relevant library and object files took a lot of work.
