In December 2019, we published a blog post on augmenting analysis using Microsoft Excel for various data sets for incident response investigations.
As we described, investigations often include custom or proprietary log formats and miscellaneous, non-traditional forensic artifacts.
There are, of course, a variety of ways to tackle this task, but Excel stands out as a reliable way to analyze and transform a majority of data sets we encounter.
In our first post, we discussed summarizing verbose artifacts using the CONCAT function, converting timestamps using the TIME function, and using the COUNTIF function for log baselining.
