If an app has the Android permission CALL_PHONE, and is using InMobi versions 3.6.2 to 4.0.2, an attacker over the network (for example, using Wi-Fi or DNS hijacking) could abuse the makeCall annotation in the app to make phone calls on the device without a user’s consent – including to premium numbers.
In addition, without requiring special Android permissions in the host app, attackers over the network, via HTTP or DNS hijacking, could also misuse the aforementioned exposed methods to misguide the user to post to the user’s social network from the device ( postToSocial in version 3.7.0 and above), send email to any designated recipient with a pre-crafted title and email body ( sendMail in version 3.6.2 and above), send SMS to premium numbers ( sendSMS in version 3.6.2 and above), create calendar events on the device ( createCalendarEvent in version 3.7.0 and above), and to take pictures and access the photo gallery on the device ( takeCameraPicture and getGalleryImage in version 3.7.0 and above).
