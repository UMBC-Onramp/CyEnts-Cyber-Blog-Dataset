The module will record the user’s password attempt and reply back to Azure AD on behalf of the PTA Agent.
This reply advises Azure AD the password attempt was valid and grants the user access to the cloud, even if the password is incorrect.
If an attacker has implanted AADIntPTASpy , they can log in as any user that attempts to authenticate using PTA—and will be granted access.
Additionally, all password attempts that are registered by the AADIntPTASpy module are recorded within a log file on the server (Default location: C:\\PTASpy\\PTASPy.csv ).
Figure 2 shows how the log file can be decoded to reveal a user’s password in cleartext.
