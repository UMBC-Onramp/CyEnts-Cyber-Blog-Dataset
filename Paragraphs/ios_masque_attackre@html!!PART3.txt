We describe these two parts of Masque Attack II in the following sections.
Bypassing Prompt for Trust When the user clicks to open an enterprise-signed app for the first time, iOS asks whether the user trusts the signing party.
The app won’t launch unless the user chooses “Trust”.
  Apple suggested defending against Masque Attack by the aid of this “Don’t Trust” prompt [8].
We notified Apple that this was inadequate.
We find that when calling an iOS URL scheme, iOS launches the enterprise-signed app registered to handle the URL scheme without prompting for trust.
It doesn’t matter whether the user has launched that enterprise-signed app before.
Even if the user has always clicked “Don’t Trust”, iOS still launches that enterprise-signed app directly upon calling its URL scheme.
In other words, when the user clicks on a link in SMS, iOS Mail or Google Inbox, iOS launches the target enterprise-signed app without asking for user’s “Trust” or even ignores user’s “Don’t Trust”.
