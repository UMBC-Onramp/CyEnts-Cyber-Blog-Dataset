Since it has been reported that many phishing and spearphishing attacks are being delivered as part of social engineering distribution mechanisms, end-users must also be made aware of the various types of attacks currently in use.
The FortiPhish cloud-based phishing simulation service uses real-world simulated phishing attacks and analysis to test user awareness and vigilance and help hone training efforts.
Regular training sessions on how to spot emails with malicious attachments or links combined with impromptu tests increase user awareness and helps prevent initial access into the network.
Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) addresses all types of attacks/threats:
Reduces Attack Surface—ZTNA only allows access to specifically requested applications rather than the network-level access provided by traditional VPN.
Ensures Endpoint Security Compliance—Checks to ensure the endpoint is compliant with your security policies (no critical vulnerabilities, has adequate security enabled, etc.) and only grants access to compliant endpoints.
