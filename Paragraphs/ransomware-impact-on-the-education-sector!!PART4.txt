Grief ransomware, also known as GriefOrPay, is thought to be a rebrand of the DoppelPaymer ransomware.
DoppelPaymer has been around since at least July 2019 and is a member of the BitPaymer ransomware family.
While the reason behind rebranding from DoppelPaymer to Grief is not apparent, it happened after the Colonial Pipeline incident.
One theory is that the rebrand was to take law enforcement’s attention away from the group.
Ransomware gangs work like scam companies that change their names, logos, and registration after enough money is collected from the victims to divert unwanted attention from law enforcement.
While its intrusion tactics are not yet identified, likely the Grief attack indirectly relies on spam emails as the DoppelyPaymer payload is thought to be distributed via the Dridex botnet.
Another report suggests the presence of Cobalt Strike in some machines infected with Grief.
Grief is also double-extortion ransomware, demanding ransom payments in Monero cryptocurrency for file decryption and not releasing harvested data.
