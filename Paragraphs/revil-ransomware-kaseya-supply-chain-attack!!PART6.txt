Who Has Been Impacted?
Researchers say that the number of victims is rising over time.
At the time of this writing, at least 1,000 organizations have seen some impact by the attack and its consequences to their business continuity.
One of the victims notably impacted by this attack has been a Swedish supermarket chain, “Coop”.
With over 800 physical grocery stores, many of which were shut down after the attack, it is not yet clear when recovery could allow for Coop to fully resume operations.
Organizations in several industries have reported issues, with victims identified in government, professional services, retail, and wholesale, to name a few.
