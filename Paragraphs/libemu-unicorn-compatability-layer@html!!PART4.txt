There is one common case of direct member access to the emu_cpu structure that requires some special attention.
This structure gives the user direct read/write access to the emulatorâ€™s virtual processor and is commonly utilized by user code.
Examples to support include: The next task was to see if we could mimic the direct access to the emu_cpu elements as if they were static struct fields.
