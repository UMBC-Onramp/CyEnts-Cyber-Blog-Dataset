Additional VBA code from System.doc Upon first execution of TONEDEAF, FireEye identified a callback to the C2 server offlineearthquake[.]com over port 80.
The FireEye Footprint: Pivots and Victim Identification After identifying the usage of offlineearthquake[.]com as a potential C2 domain, FireEye’s Intelligence and Advanced Practices teams performed a wider search across our global visibility.
FireEye’s Advanced Practices and Intelligence teams were able to identify additional artifacts and activity from the APT34 actors at other victim organizations.
Of note, FireEye discovered two additional new malware families hosted at this domain, VALUEVAULT and LONGWATCH.
We also identified a variant of PICKPOCKET, a browser credential-theft tool FireEye has been tracking since May 2018, hosted on the C2.
Requests to the domain offlineearthquake[.]com could take multiple forms, depending on the malware’s stage of installation and purpose.
Additionally, during installation, the malware retrieves the system and current user names, which are used to create a three-character “sys_id”.
