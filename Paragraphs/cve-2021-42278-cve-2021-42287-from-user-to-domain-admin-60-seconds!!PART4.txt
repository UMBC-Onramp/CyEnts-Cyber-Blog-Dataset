CVE-2021-42287 - Kerberos Key Distribution Center Confusion The Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is a service of Active Directory that handles Kerberos ticket requests.
A Ticket-Granting Ticket, or TGT, is a special type of ticket that can be used to obtain other tickets.
TGT is used to request access tokens from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) for specific resources/systems in the domain.
When a request for a service ticket is sent and it is not found, the KDC will automatically lookup the requested ticket appended with “$”.
S4U2self, or Service for User to Self, is an extension that allows a service to obtain a Kerberos service ticket for itself.
The service ticket contains the user's groups and can therefore be used in authorization decisions.
