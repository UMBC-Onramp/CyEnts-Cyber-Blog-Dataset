Mirai has become such a common discovery in the wild that it is beginning to be disregarded as white noise, played off as a simple attack that should be readily stopped by common security products.
This is dangerous thinking and will lull security professionals and executives into complacency.
Juniper Threat Labs has discovered a new attack, based off of Mirai from an attacker who originally appeared to be calling themselves “Priority”.
In later versions, this attacker took that out of the code and started deploying a more advanced version of Mirai.
