JSPatch is one of several different offerings that provide a low-cost and streamlined patching process for iOS developers.
All of these offerings expose a similar attack vector that allows patching scripts to alter the app behavior at runtime, without the constraints imposed by the App Store’s vetting process.
Our demonstration of abusing JSPatch capabilities for malicious gain, as well as our presentation of different attack scenarios, highlights an urgent problem and an imperative need for a better solution – notably due to a growing number of app developers in China and beyond having adopted JSPatch.
