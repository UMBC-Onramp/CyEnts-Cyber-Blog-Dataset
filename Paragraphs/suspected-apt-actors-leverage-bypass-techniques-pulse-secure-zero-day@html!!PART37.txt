The patcher accepts four arguments.
The first argument is the original binary path, the second the patched output file path, third is the backdoor bypass password, and fourth is the letter e specifying to apply patches.
The sample reads the original binary into memory, applies the assembly patches associated with SLOWPULSE V3, as well as the provided bypass password, then written to the output path.
The assembly patches, and all offsets including where to copy the bypass password are hardcoded.
SLOWPULSE Variant 4 Patcher As part of our investigation into the SLOWPULSE family we recovered the utility the attacker used to insert the malicious logic into the original libdsplibs.so file.
