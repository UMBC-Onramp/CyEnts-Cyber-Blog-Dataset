The system information includes: Computer Name User Name IP Address Active Code Page OEM Page OS Version Architecture Details (x32/x64)
String at 0x68 offset from decrypted config file This information is retrieved from the victim using the following WINAPI calls:
Format = \"%s;%s;%s;%d;%d;%s;%s %dbit\" GetComputerNameA GetUserNameA Gethostbyname and inet_ntoa GetACP GetOEMPC GetCurrentProcess and IsWow64Process Figure 13:
System information The collected system information is concatenated together with a semicolon separating each field: WIN732BIT-L-0;Administrator;10.128.62.115;1252;437;d0c;Windows 7 32bit This information is encrypted using an XOR operation.
The response from the second GET request is used as the encryption key.
As shown in Figure 10, the second GET request responds with a 4-byte XOR key.
In this case the key is 0xE5044C18 .
Once encrypted, the system information is sent in the body of an HTTP POST.
Figure 14 shows data sent over the network with the POST request.
