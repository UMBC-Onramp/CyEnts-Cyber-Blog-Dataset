Although the crash dump provides us with a lot of good information, there is still a lot we do not know.
For example, the crash occurs in the “WemoApp” and provides us an offset, but what is the base address of this library?
What has been overwritten on the stack?
Without access to the application during runtime these questions are difficult to answer.
Because we obtained the file system earlier, we could statically analyze the WemoApp binary; but we would still be unable to determine the exact point of the crash easily.
