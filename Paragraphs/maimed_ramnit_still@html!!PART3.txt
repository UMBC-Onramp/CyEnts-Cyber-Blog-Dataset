The FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) first discovered that the site was compromised and used to host VBS/Ramnit on Jan. 28, 2016.
We can confirm that the infection is still live as of the time of this writing.
IE users who visit the site may be compromised if they browse to a specific page (paperindex[.]htm) and click ‘Yes’ to run ActiveX, which may appear to be safe since the website is familiar and popular.
