The public key encrypts the Salsa20 key and random initialization vector (IV, or nonce)) generated later for each file.
The encryption procedure generates a random Salsa20 key and a random IV for each file, encrypts the file with them, and encrypts this key and IV with a pair of RSA keys (with the public RSA key created at the beginning).
The private key remains encrypted in the registry using another Salsa20 key and IV encrypted with an RSA public key embedded in the malware.
After encryption, the file key and IV are appended to the contents of the file in a new field of 8 bytes, increasing the original file size.
This method makes GandCrab very strong ransomware because without the private key to the embedded public key, it is not possible to decrypt the files.
