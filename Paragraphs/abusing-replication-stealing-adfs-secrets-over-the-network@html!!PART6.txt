This is called the Token Signing Certificate.
The Token Signing Certificate is the bedrock of security in AD FS.
Microsoft 365 uses the digital signature to validate that the SAML token is authentic, valid, and comes from an AD FS server that it trusts.
To enable this verification, an administrator shares the public component of the Token Signing Certificate with Microsoft 365.
This is then used to cryptographically verify the digital signature in the SAML token and prove authenticity as well as integrity of the token.
In other words, if a threat actor got hold of a Token Signing Certificate, they could generate arbitrary SAML tokens to access any federated application, as any user, and even bypass MFA.
