The campaign originally piqued our interest due to the continuous updating of its list of target vulnerabilities—more so than other campaigns we have seen so far.
TP-Link has already released an updated firmware for this affected hardware version  and users are strongly encouraged to update their devices.
This post details how this threat leverages the new vulnerability to take over the affected devices and ways to protect users from these attacks.
Exploiting a New Vulnerability This Mirai-based botnet campaign is referred to as MANGA because of the token string it used to include in its SSH/telnet commands.
It is also referred to as Dark due to the filenames used for its binaries (e.g., Dark.arm, dark.mips, etc.).
By exploiting recently published vulnerabilities, this malware campaign capitalizes on the gap between the time of disclosure of a vulnerability and the application of a patch to compromise IoT devices.
