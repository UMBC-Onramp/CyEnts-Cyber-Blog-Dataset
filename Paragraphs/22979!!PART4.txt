On Google Play, our mobile antivirus app is currently called Kaspersky Mobile Antivirus: Applock & Web Security .
Ironically, users who downloaded the fake antivirus app received a banking Trojan known as TeaBot, which our security products detect as HEUR: Trojan-Banker.
AndroidOS.Teaban or HEUR:
Trojan-Banker.
AndroidOS.Regon.
Why is this especially problematic in the case of antivirus apps?
Itâ€™s because the user not only downloads and installs a banking Trojan disguised like this, but also grants it all of the permissions it requests.
After all, an authentic antivirus app needs a lot of permissions, including very powerful access such as Accessibility services .
Worse, in the absence of actual antivirus protection, the device cannot detect the malware.
Completing installation and granting all requested permissions gives the TeaBot Trojan the ability to do almost anything on the Android device.
