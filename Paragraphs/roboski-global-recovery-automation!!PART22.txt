Figure 7: Converted data executed and invoked The parameters stored within ChannelSinkStack are the hex-encoded values for the resource named EventWaitHandleRights and a base XOR key ‘xNksm.’
Figure 8: ChannelSinkStack parameters RoboSki.
Component As described above, during execution the RoboSki component is provided as a resource and XOR key parameters, and proceeds to decode and decrypt the ReZer0 loader from the RoboSki packer.
The component loads the resource and arranges the pixels in BGRA order.
The component then parses the resource according to the structure below, and XOR decrypts the data using the results of permutations against the base XOR key and a control key.
