Interestingly, this patch changes the strict minimum number of bytes, while the version number of the DLL remains unchanged.
Using the popular diffing tool Diaphora, we compared the version of jscript.dll for Windows 10, x64-bit edition (feature version 1809).
We can see that only a few functions were modified.
All but one point to array-related functions.
Those were probably patches addressing CVE 2018-8631 (jscript!JsArrayFunctionHeapSort out-of-bounds write).
