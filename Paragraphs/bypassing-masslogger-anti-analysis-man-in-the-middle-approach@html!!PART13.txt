There are two types of .NET methods: a tiny method and a fat method.
Looking at the first byte of the method body header, the two least-significant bits tell us if the method is tiny (where the last two bits are 10 ) or fat (where the last two bits are 11 ).

Tiny Method Letâ€™s look at method 0x06000495 .
Following the same steps described earlier, we check the row number 0x495 ( 1173 in decimal) of the Method table to find the method body RVA is 0x7A7C which translates to 0x5C7C as the offset into the file.
At this offset, the first byte of the method body is 0x0A ( 0000 1010 in binary).
Figure 8: Method 0x06000495 metadata and body Since the two least-significant bits are 10 , we know that 0x06000495 is a tiny method.
