We did not push the exploitation further than the Proof of Concept shown in the above video, but we can assume that at this point, building a weaponized version able to threaten private networks is more of a software engineering task and a skilled attacker might only need a few weeks, if not days, to put one together.
Remediation Upon finding the flaw, we immediately notified Avaya with detailed instructions on how to reproduce the bug and suggested fixes.
They were able to fix, test and release a patched firmware image in approximately two months.
At the time of publication, the fix will have been out for more than 30 days, leaving IT administrators ample time to deploy the new image.
