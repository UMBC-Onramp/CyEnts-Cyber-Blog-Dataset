We have been performing Red Team assessments for customers around the world for over 15 years.
In that time, we have built up a set of scripts, tools, scanners, and techniques to help improve our clientsâ€™ security postures.
Unfortunately, these tools were stolen by a highly sophisticated attacker.
The stolen tools range from simple scripts used for automating reconnaissance to entire frameworks that are similar to publicly available technologies such as CobaltStrike and Metasploit.
Many of the Red Team tools have already been released to the community and are already distributed in our open-source virtual machine, CommandoVM .
Some of the tools are publicly available tools modified to evade basic security detection mechanisms.
Other tools and frameworks were developed in-house for our Red Team.
No Zero-Day Exploits or Unknown Techniques
The Red Team tools stolen by the attacker did not contain zero-day exploits.
The tools apply well-known and documented methods that are used by other red teams around the world.
