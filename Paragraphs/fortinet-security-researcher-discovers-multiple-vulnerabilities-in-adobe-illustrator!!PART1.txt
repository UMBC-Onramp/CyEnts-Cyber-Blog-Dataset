In August of 2021, I discovered and reported multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Illustrator to Adobe, Inc.
On Tuesday, October 26, 2021, Adobe released several security patches that fixed these vulnerabilities.
They are identified as CVE-2021-40718, CVE-2021-40746, CVE-2021-40747, CVE-2021-40748 and CVE-2021-40749.
All these vulnerabilities have similar root causes related to a single Illustrator Plugin.
We suggest users apply the Adobe patches as soon as possible.
