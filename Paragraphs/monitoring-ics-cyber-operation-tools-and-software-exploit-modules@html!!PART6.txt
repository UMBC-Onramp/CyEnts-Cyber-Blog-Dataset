Figure 2: ICS-specific intrusion and attack tools by class Software Exploit Modules Software exploit modules are the most numerous subcomponents of cyber operation tools given their overall simplicity and accessibility.
Most frequently, exploit modules are developed to take advantage of a specific vulnerability and automate the exploitation process.
The module is then added to an exploit framework.
The framework works as a repository that may contain hundreds of modules for targeting a wide variety of vulnerabilities, networks, and devices.
