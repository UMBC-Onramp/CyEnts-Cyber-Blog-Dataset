FIGURE 3.
CREATION OF A MUTEX AND CHECK TO SEE IF IT ALREADY EXISTS If the mutex exists, the malware finishes with a call to “ExitProcess.”
This is done to avoid re-launching of the ransomware.
After this mutex operation the malware calculates a CRC32 hash of a part of its data using a special seed that changes per sample too.
This CRC32 operation is based on a CRC32 polynomial operation instead of tables to make it faster and the code-size smaller.
The next step is decrypting this block of data if the CRC32 check passes with success.
If the check is a failure, the malware will ignore this flow of code and try to use an exploit as will be explained later in the report.
FIGURE 4.
CALCULATION OF THE CRC32 HASH OF THE CRYPTED CONFIG AND DECRYPTION
IF IT PASSES THE CHECK
In the case that the malware passes the CRC32 check and decrypts correctly with a key that changes per sample, the block of data will get a JSON file in memory that will be parsed.
This config file has fields to prepare the keys later to encrypt the victim key and more information that will alter the behavior of the malware.
