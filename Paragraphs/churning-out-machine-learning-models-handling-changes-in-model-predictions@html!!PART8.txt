Our setup splits the data into three sets to simulate model training, then retraining while keeping an independent data set for final evaluation.
Figure 2 shows our data split and how it compares to the original EMBER data split.
We have built a LightGBM classifier on the training data, which weâ€™ll refer to as the baseline model.
To simulate production testing, we run the baseline model on test 1 and record the FPs and FNs.
Then, we retrain our model using both the training data and the FPs/FNs from test 1.
