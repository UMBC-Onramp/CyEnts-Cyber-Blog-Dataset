However, after three minutes the system rebooted again.
Figure 19 shows the message the team caught on reboot after several repeated experiments with the same results.

This indicates that in the boot phase of startup, a hardware watchdog is set to 180 seconds (or three minutes).
The system has two watchdog timers, one hardware and one software; we had only disabled one of the timers.
The same method of patching the binary which was used to disable the software watchdog timer would not work for the hardware watchdog timer; the application would also need to kick the watchdog to prevent a reboot.
Armed with this knowledge, we turned to the Delta binaries on the device for code that could help us “kick” the hardware watchdog.
With the debugging symbols left in, it was relatively easy to find a function which was responsible for managing the hardware watchdog.
