The config_t.encoded_config blob can be decoded by XOR-ing the data with the config_header_t.xor_val_1.
The decoded configuration data consists of a comma-separated list of URLs followed by a key that is used in the communication module.
The first two bytes specify the lengths of the comma-separated URL list and the key, respectively.
The URLs in the observed samples follow the pattern shown in Figure 13.
