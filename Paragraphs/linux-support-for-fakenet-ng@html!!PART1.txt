Introduction In 2016, FLARE introduced FakeNet-NG , an open-source network analysis tool written in Python.
FakeNet-NG allows security analysts to observe and interact with network applications using standard or custom protocols on a single Windows host, which is especially useful for malware analysis and reverse engineering.
Since FakeNet-NGâ€™s release, FLARE has added support for additional protocols.
FakeNet-NG now has out-of-the-box support for DNS, HTTP (including BITS), FTP, TFTP, IRC, SMTP, POP, TCP, and UDP as well as SSL.
Building on this work, FLARE has now brought FakeNet-NG to Linux.
This allows analysts to perform basic dynamic analysis either on a single Linux host or using a separate, dedicated machine in the same way as INetSim.
INetSim has made amazing contributions to the productivity of the security community and is still the tool of choice for many analysts.
Now, FakeNet-NG gives analysts a cross-platform tool for malware analysis that can directly integrate with all the great Python-based infosec tools that continually emerge in the field.
