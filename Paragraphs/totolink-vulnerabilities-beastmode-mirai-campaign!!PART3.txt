CVE-2022-25075 / 25076 / 25077 / 25078 / 25079 / 25080 / 25081 / 25082 / 25083 / 25084 are a family of similar vulnerabilities targeting TOTOLINK A810R, A830R, A860R, A950RG, A3100R, A3600R, T6, and T10 routers.
(Figure 4).
Interestingly, the samples caught on 20 Feb 2022 contained a typo in the URL, where “downloadFile.cgi” was used instead of “downloadFlile.cgi” used by the devices.
This had been fixed in samples captured three days later, suggesting active development and operation of this campaign.
Apart from TOTOLINK products, this campaign also targets discontinued D-Link products (DIR-810L, DIR-820L/LW, DIR-826L, DIR-830L and DIR-836L) via CVE-2021-45382 (Figure 5).
Note that updated firmware is not available as these products have reached their end of life/support cycles.
It is interesting to note that this campaign also attempts to exploit CVE-2021-4045 (Figure 6), a vulnerability for the TP-Link Tapo C200 IP camera, which we have not observed in other Mirai-based campaigns.
While the current implementation of the exploit is incorrect, device owners should still update their camera firmware to fix this vulnerability.
