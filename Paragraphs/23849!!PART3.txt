Judging by the discussion in the Dark Souls community, the creator of the exploit has been trying to inform the game’s developers about this serious vulnerability for some time, but they had ignored his messages.
That’s why he decided to hack a popular streamer right during the streaming session.
However, this information is not 100% reliable, in reality everything may not be so straight-forward.
For example, the creator of the exploit has already shared information about the vulnerability with the developers of the Blue Sentinel plugin, a mod for Dark Souls designed to counteract cheats.
