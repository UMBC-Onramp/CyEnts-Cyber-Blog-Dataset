So, regardless of their activity level, it pays to be alert.
Download apps only from official sources.
True, this is not a 100% security guarantee, but there are far less malicious programs in official stores, and even when malware slips through moderation it usually gets removed from the store relatively quickly.
Whenever possible, use apps from trusted developers with a good reputation to minimize the chances of encountering malware.
Ignore apps that promise payouts you’ve never heard of or overly generous prizes.
It’s almost bound to be a scam.
Don’t give apps permissions they don’t need to work.
Most malware will not be able to deploy fully without potentially dangerous permissions , for example, access to Accessibility, access to text messages and installation of unknown apps .
Use a reliable mobile antivirus that will detect and block malware that tries to get inside your phone.
