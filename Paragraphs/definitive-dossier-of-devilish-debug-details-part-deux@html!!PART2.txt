Rarely do we encounter static malware features with such an interesting tie to the human behind the keyboard, rather than the functionality of the file.
Second, file paths are an incredibly complex artifact with many different possible encodings.
We had personally been dying to find an excuse to spend more time figuring out how to parse and encode paths in a more useful way.
This presented an opportunity to dive into this space and test different approaches to representing file paths in various models.
The objectives of our project were: Build a large data set of PDB paths and apply some statistical methods to find potentially new signature terms and logic.
Investigate whether applying machine learning classification approaches to this problem could improve our detection above writing hand-crafted signatures.
