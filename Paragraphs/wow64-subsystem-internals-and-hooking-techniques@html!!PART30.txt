X64 MSVC doesn’t support this and there are complications with REX prefixes when using that method.
It’s nicer to use external masm files and rely on the linker to implement this shellcode.
Arg Number Cdecl Location Fastcall Location Special Case? 0
[ebp + 8] rcx
Yes 1 [ebp + 12] rdx
Yes 2 [ebp + 16] r8d Yes 3 [ebp + 20] r9d Yes 4 [ebp + 24] [rbp + 32 + 8]
No 5 [ebp + 28] [rbp + 32 + 16]
No 6 [ebp + 32] [rbp + 32 + 24]
No Figure 19:
Cdecl vs Fastcall argument positions Once this shellcode is written and wrapped into a nice C++ function, it’s possible for the wow64log DLL to invoke the callback via a simple C style function pointer call shown in Figure 20.
