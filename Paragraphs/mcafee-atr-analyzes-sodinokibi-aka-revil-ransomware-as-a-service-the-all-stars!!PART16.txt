Below is a screenshot of the posting.
Interesting is the response from a user with the nickname Lalartu.
In a reply to the advertisement, Lalartu mentions that he is working with UNKN and his team, as well as that they had been a former GandCrab affiliate, something that was noticed by Bleepingcomputer too.
Lalartuâ€™s post supports our earlier observations that some top GandCrab affiliates suddenly disappeared and might have moved to a different RaaS family.
This is something that was suspected but never confirmed with technical evidence.
We suspect that Lalartu is not the only GandCrab affiliate that has moved to Sodinokibi.
If top affiliates have a solid and very profitable infection method available, then it does not make sense to retire with the developers.
