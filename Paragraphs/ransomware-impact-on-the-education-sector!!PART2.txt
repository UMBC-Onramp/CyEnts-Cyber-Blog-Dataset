In July, REvil struck again, affecting customers of the managed services provider Kaseya.
 Attackers exploited an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Kaseya VSA (Virtual System Administrator) software, allowing attackers to distribute a malicious payload to downstream customers through hosts managed by the software.
Because the prime goal of ransomware gangs is financial gain, the education sector was generally thought to be outside of bad guys’ targets.
However, a report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
 has suggested otherwise.
 
The FBI released a Flash alert on March 16 th , warning the public of the PYSA ransomware increasingly targeting education institutions in the US and UK.
PYSA, also known as Mespinoza, is an abbreviation for “Protect Your System Amigo” and is thought to have a close kinship to the Vurten ransomware.
PYSA was first spotted in December 2019.
At that time, it added a “.locked” file extension to the files it encrypted, but it later switched to the more familiar “.pysa” file extension.
PYSA’s entry points are generally attributed to three methods: spam emails, intrusion to a Windows host with RDP exposed to the internet, and brute force attacks against a central management console as well as some Active Directory (AD) accounts.
