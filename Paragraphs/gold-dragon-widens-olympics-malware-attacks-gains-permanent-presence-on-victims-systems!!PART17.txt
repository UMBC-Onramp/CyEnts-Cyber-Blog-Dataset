Once the second DLL is executed, it gathers information about the victim systemâ€™s setup, such as operating system version, and driver and processor information.
The malware initiates its main function of capturing user keystrokes and sending them to the control server using standard Windows networking APIs.
From our analysis, stealing keystrokes is the main function of RunningRat; however, the DLL has code for more extensive functionality.
Code is included to copy the clipboard, delete files, compress files, clear event logs, shut down the machine, and much more.
However, our current analysis shows no way for such code to be executed.
McAfee ATR analysts will continue to research RunningRat to determine if this extra code is used or is possibly left over from a larger RAT toolkit.
