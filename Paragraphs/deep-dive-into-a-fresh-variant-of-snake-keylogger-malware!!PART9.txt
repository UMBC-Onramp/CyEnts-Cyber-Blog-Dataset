It plans to read a Resource named \"Qkxkikeg\" from the current module, which has no such named resource in the Resource directory, as you can see in Figure 3.3.
A resource loading failure occurs and the registered local ResolveEventHandler function is called to solve this error.
This then causes a loading assembly failure and its assembly resolve callback function is called.
A while later, another PE file, decrypted from resource “{d977ee8c-85ce-4731-b9a1-323ba88c6eeb}‎”, appears in memory.
It contains a resource with the name “Qkxkikeg”, which is the original request resource name, as shown in Figure 3.4.
