Juniper Threat Labs compiled a list of the payloads from log4j attacks we have seen as of 12/16.
Most of the payloads install malware such as Muhstik, Kinsing, Mirai and Cryptominers.
We have also seen installation of a file infector malware.
We have also observed malicious attacks that open a reverse shell on the target, as well as attacks that attempt to dump AWS credentials.
There are also a large number of benign scans coming from test or security organizations.
To be able to have a better understanding of the attacks, we will briefly detail how this specific attack works.
The majority of the attacks have the strings “Basic/Command/Base64/ ” or “ Basic/ReverseShell”.
