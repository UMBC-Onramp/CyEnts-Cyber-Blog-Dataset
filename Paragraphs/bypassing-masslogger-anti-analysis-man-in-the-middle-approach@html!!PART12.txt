This RVA belongs to the .text section whose RVA is 0x2000 .
Therefore, this method body begins at 0x9690 ( 0xB690 â€“ 0x2000 ) bytes into the .text section.
The .text section starts at 0x200 bytes into the file according to the section header.
As a result, we can find the method body at 0x9890 ( 0x9690 + 0x200 ) bytes offset into the file.
We can see the method body in Figure 7.
