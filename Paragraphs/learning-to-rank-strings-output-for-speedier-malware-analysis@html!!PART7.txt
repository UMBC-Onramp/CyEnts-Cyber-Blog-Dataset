We provide a high-level overview of how this works in Figure 2.
In the initial train() step of Figure 2, over 25 thousand binaries are run through the Strings program to generate training data consisting of over 18 million total strings .
Each training sample then corresponds to the concatenated list of ASCII and Unicode strings output by the Strings program on that input file.
