Figure 11:
Hot air rework/reflow station While using the hot air to warm the IC and surrounding areas, we gently nudged the flash to see if the solder had become molten.
Once the chip appeared to be floating, we quickly removed the chip and let it cool for about 30 seconds.
Figure 12 shows the IC flash removed from the PCB, with the solder still present on the BGA pads.
Figure 12: NAND removed from X2e Before inserting the NAND into a clam-shell chip reader, the leftover solder must be removed from the flash.
This can be accomplished using a soldering iron, high-quality flux, and de-soldering wick.
Once removed, isopropyl alcohol and a toothbrush are highly effective at removing the leftover flux residue and cleaning the chip.
In the next section, weâ€™ll attempt to extract the data from the NAND chip using a multi-purpose chip programmer.
