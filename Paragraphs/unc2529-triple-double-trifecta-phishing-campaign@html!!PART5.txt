Mandiant tracks this third-stage backdoor as DOUBLEBACK.
DOUBLEBACK samples observed during the phishing campaign beaconed to hxxps://klikbets[.]net/admin/client.php and hxxps://lasartoria[.]net/admin/client.php.
Prior to the second wave, observed between Dec. 11Â and Dec. 18, 2020, UNC2529 hijacked a legitimate domain owned by a U.S. heating and cooling services company, modified DNS entries and leveraged that infrastructure to phish at least 22 organizations, five of which were also targeted in the first wave.
It is not currently known how the legitimate domain was compromised.
The threat actor used 20 newly observed domains to host the second-stage payload.
The threat actor made slight modifications to the URL pattern during the second wave.
http://<fqdn>/<string> http://<fqdn>/dowld_<string> http://<fqdn>/download_<string> http://<fqdn>/files_<string> http://<fqdn>/id_<string> http://<fqdn>/upld_<string>
Of note, the DOUBLEDRAG downloader observed in the first wave was replaced with a Microsoft Excel document containing an embedded legacy Excel 4.0 (XLM) macro in Excel 97-Excel 2003 Binary file format (BIFF8).
When the file was opened and the macro executed successfully, it would attempt to download a second-stage payload from hxxps://towncentrehotels[.]com/ps1.dat.
