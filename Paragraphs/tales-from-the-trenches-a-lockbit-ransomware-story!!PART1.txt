In collaboration with Northwave As we highlighted previously across two blogs, targeted ransomware attacks have increased massively over the past months.
In our first article , we discussed the growing pattern of targeted ransomware attacks where the primary infection stage is often an info-stealer kind of malware used to gain credentials/access to determine if the target would be valuable for a ransomware attack.
In the second part , we described the reconnaissance phase of an attacker that controls an infected host or a valid account to access a remote service.
Many of them are using a similar manual modus operandi as we highlighted in the earlier blogs.
We believe there is real opportunity to learn from incident response cases and previous attacks, hence why this blog is dubbed ‘tales from the trenches’.
In collaboration with Northwave , this article describes a real-life case of a targeted ransomware attack.
During one of their recent incident responses, Northwave encountered a relatively new family of ransomware called LockBit performing a targeted attack.
First sighted in late 2019, under the name .abcd virus, this piece of ransomware was more a revision than evolution when compared with earlier attacks.
