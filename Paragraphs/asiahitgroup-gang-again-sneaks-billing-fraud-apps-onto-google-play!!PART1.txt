By Carlos Castillo on Jun 27, 2018 The McAfee Mobile Research team has found a new billing-fraud campaign of at least 15 apps published in 2018 on Google Play.
Toll fraud (which includes WAP billing fraud) is a leading category of potentially harmful apps on Google Play, according to the report Android Security 2017 Year in Review.
This new campaign demonstrates that cybercriminals keep finding new ways to steal money from victims using apps on official stores such as Google Play.
The AsiaHitGroup Gang has been active since at least late 2016 with the distribution of the fake-installer applications Sonvpay.
