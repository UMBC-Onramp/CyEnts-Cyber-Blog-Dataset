MSDBLIB Juniper SecIntel offers curated threat intelligence that is continuously updated, actionable and validated by Juniper Threat Labs.
This includes a Command and Control (CnC) feed that provides Command and Control IPs that attackers are using to establish persistence, control malware or maintain their connection to your network.
We also recently added a new Attacker IP feed that contains IPs that were seen attempting to compromise our sensor network to establish the persistence that the attacker is seeking to maintain.
