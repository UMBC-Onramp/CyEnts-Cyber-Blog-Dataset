Complete Mission
Despite this multi-staged operation, Mandiant did not observe evidence of data exfiltration and was unable to determine UNC1945's mission for most of the intrusions we investigated.
In at least one case, we observed ROLLCOAST ransomware deployment in the final phase of the threat actor activity, but Mandiant didnâ€™t attribute this activity to UNC1945.
