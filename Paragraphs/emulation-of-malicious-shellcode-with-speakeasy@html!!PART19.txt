This file currently contains debug interrupt instructions (int3), so if the malware attempts to execute the data it exits and will be logged in the report.
Using this, we can easily label the malware as a downloader that downloads additional code.
Configuration fields also exist for file system and registry emulation.
Files and registry paths can similarly be configured to return data to samples that expect to be running on a live Windows system.
