We explore additional technical details of TONEDEAF in the malware appendix of this post.
Retracing the steps preceding exploit detection, FireEye identified that System.doc was dropped by a file named ERFT-Details.xls .
Combining endpoint- and network-visibility, we were able to correlate that ERFT-Details.xls originated from the URL http://www.cam-research-ac[.]com/Documents/ERFT-Details.xls .
Network evidence also showed the access of a LinkedIn message directly preceding the spreadsheet download.
Managed Defense reached out to the impacted customer’s security team, who confirmed the file was received via a LinkedIn message.
The targeted employee conversed with \"Rebecca Watts\", allegedly employed as \"Research Staff at University of Cambridge\".
The conversation with Ms. Watts, provided in Figure 1, began with the solicitation of resumes for potential job opportunities.

This is not the first time we’ve seen APT34 utilize academia and/or job offer conversations in their various campaigns.
These conversations often take place on social media platforms, which can be an effective delivery mechanism if a targeted organization is focusing heavily on e-mail defenses to prevent intrusions.
