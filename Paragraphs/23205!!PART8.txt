Make your account private
What if you’re not famous enough to pass blue-check verification?
You can take the radical step of closing your account to the public.
If you make your account private, then your posts, photos, and videos will be available only to subscribers, which means that an attacker won’t be able to copy them and accuse you of impersonation.
Whether in the app or a browser, it is not difficult to make your account private.
