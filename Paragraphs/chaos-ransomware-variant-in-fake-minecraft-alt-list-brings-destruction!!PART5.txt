Once the attack takes place, a dropped ReadMe.txt files ask the victim to pay a ransom in either bitcoin or pre-paid cards.
The requested amount to decrypt the files is equal to 2,000 yen (approx.
US $17), which is dirt cheap compared to the amounts other ransomware attacks typically demand.

All kinds of pre-paid cards (online shopping, gaming, music, mobile phone charge and online streaming services) are available in convenience stores.
Japan has more than 50,000 convenience store locations selling pre-paid cards and most are open 24/7.
