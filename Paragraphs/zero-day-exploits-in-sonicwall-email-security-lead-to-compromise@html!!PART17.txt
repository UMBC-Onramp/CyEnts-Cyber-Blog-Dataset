We observed the adversary leveraging Impacketâ€™s publicly available WMIEXEC.PY tool to access several internal hosts, which enabled remote command execution over Microsoft's DCOM protocol via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
The adversary managed to briefly perform internal reconnaissance activity prior to being isolated and removed from the environment.
Attribution Mandiant currently tracks this activity as UNC2682.
Ultimately, Mandiant prevented UNC2682 from completing their mission so their objectives of the attack currently remain unknown.
Each investigation conducted by Mandiant includes analysts from our Advanced Practices team who work to correlate activity observed in the thousands of investigations that Mandiant responds to.
At times, we do not have the data available to directly attribute intrusion activity to a previously known group.
In these cases, we create a new UNC group to track the activity that we observed.
An UNC group is a cluster of related cyber intrusion activity, which includes observable artifacts such as adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft, that we are not yet ready to give a classification such as APT or FIN.
