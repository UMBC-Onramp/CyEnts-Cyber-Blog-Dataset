Access to user workstations of target employees in these departments enabled us to: Capture keystrokes to obtain remote desktop protocol (RDP) credentials for the OT network by using a Cobalt Strike modified script Login to department file shares and extract OT system design documents Extract network design documents and backup files for OT firewall configurations found in the firewall management console Find plaintext credentials for OT management systems from operation manuals Internal reconnaissance in the IT network not only allowed us to obtain remote access credentials for the OT network, but to also gain a deeper understanding of the business processes and technical control system operations in the OT environment by reviewing internal OT-specific operational procedures and security documentation such as asset inventories and configurations.
Propagating to the OT Network During the process of propagation from IT to OT networks, an actor will leverage previously compromised systems, credentials, or applications to access systems in higher security zonesâ€”such as OT demilitarized zones (DMZ).
Based on our observations during multiple red teaming engagements and research, the most likely attack vectors for propagation are: Table 1: Most likely attack vectors for IT/OT propagation For this engagement, we initially analyzed the system architecture to define the best path to follow.
Engineers from the target organization were required to use multi-factor-authentication (MFA) to gain remote access to jumpbox servers in the OT network.
