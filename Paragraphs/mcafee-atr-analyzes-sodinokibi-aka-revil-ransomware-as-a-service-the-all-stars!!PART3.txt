GandCrab RaaS System GandCrab was a prime example of a Ransomware-as-a-Service.
RaaS follows a structure where the developers are offering their product to affiliates, partners or advertisers who are responsible for spreading the ransomware and generating infections.
The developers take a percentage of the earned income and provide the other portion to the affiliates.

HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE GANDCRAB RAAS MODEL Operating a RaaS model can be lucrative for both parties involved: Developerâ€™s perspective : The malware author/s request a percentage per payment for use of the ransomware product.
This way the developers have less risk than the affiliates spreading the malware.
The developers can set certain targets for their affiliates regarding the amount of infections they need to produce.
In a way, this is very similar to a modern sales organization in the corporate world.
Subsequently, a RaaS model offers malware authors a safe haven when they operate from a country that does not regard developing malware as a crime.
