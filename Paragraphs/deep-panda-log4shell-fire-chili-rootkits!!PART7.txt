A Stone’s Throw Away
In addition to the backdoors, we obtained a third type of sample – a dropper.
It writes three files to the disk: Benign executable – %APPDATA%\\syn.exe Milestone loader – %APPDATA%\\newdev.dll Driver – C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\crtsys.sys The payloads above are stored XOR-encrypted and LZMA-compressed.
The XOR key is a hardcoded DWORD that changes between samples.
The dropper carries two builds of the driver for 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
Using the Service Control Manager (SCM) API, it installs the build compliant with the operating system architecture as a driver named FSFilter-Min .
The dropper patches the .data section of the loader binary to add its configuration before it writes it to disk.
Next, the dropper executes syn.exe , a benign executable signed by Synaptics, in order to side-load the newdev.dll loader module.
The loader also contains a XOR-encrypted and LZMA-compressed payload, which is a Milestone backdoor.
