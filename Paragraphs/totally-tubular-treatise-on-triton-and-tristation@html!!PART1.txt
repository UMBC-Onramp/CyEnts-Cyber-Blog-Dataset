Introduction In December 2017, FireEye's Mandiant discussed an incident response involving the TRITON framework .
The TRITON attack and many of the publicly discussed ICS intrusions involved routine techniques where the threat actors used only what is necessary to succeed in their mission.
For both INDUSTROYER and TRITON, the attackers moved from the IT network to the OT (operational technology) network through systems that were accessible to both environments.
Traditional malware backdoors, Mimikatz distillates, remote desktop sessions, and other well-documented, easily-detected attack methods were used throughout these intrusions.
