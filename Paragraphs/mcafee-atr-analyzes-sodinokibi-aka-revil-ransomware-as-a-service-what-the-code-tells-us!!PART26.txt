CLEAN MEMORY OF VARS
If the malware was running as SYSTEM after the exploit, it will revert its rights and finally finish its execution.

REVERT THE SYSTEM PRIVILEGE EXECUTION LEVEL Code Comparison with GandCrab Using the unpacked Sodinokibi sample and a v5.03 version of GandCrab, we started to use IDA and BinDiff to observe any similarities.
Based on the Call-Graph it seems that there is an overall 40 percent code overlap between the two: FIGURE 20.
CALL-GRAPH COMPARISON
The most overlap seems to be in the functions of both families.
Although values change, going through the code reveals similar patterns and flows:
Although here and there are some differences, the structure is similar:
We already mentioned that the code part responsible for the random URL generation has similarities with regards to how it is generated in the GandCrab malware.
Sodinokibi is using one function to execute this part where GandCrab is using three functions to generate the random URL.
