A successful attack using this approach leaves almost no traces.
Specter.js attack on LastPass The attack on the LastPass password manager was different in that the code to steal data using Spectre v1 was embedded in a malicious extension for Google Chrome.
The LastPass extension was also running in the browser.
In some cases, the extensions are also executed in a common browser process, making data theft possible.
Specter.js attack on Google Cloud Storage Another example uses attacks on Google cloud storage: One browser tab contains a malicious page hosted on sites.google.com; another lets users upload images to their private storage in the G Suite service.
