In this blog post, we will show an example of Speakeasyâ€™s effectiveness at automatically extracting network indicators from a Cobalt Strike Beacon sample acquired from an online malware aggregate.
Background Dynamic analysis of Windows malware has always been a crucial step during the malware analysis process.
Understanding how malware interacts with the Windows API and extracting valuable host-based and network-based indicators of compromise (IOCs) are critical to assessing the impact malware has on an affected network.
Typically, dynamic analysis is performed in an automated or targeted fashion.
Malware can be queued to execute within a sandbox to monitor its functionality, or manually debugged to reveal code paths not executed during sandbox runs.
Code emulation has been used historically for testing, validation and even malware analysis.
Being able to emulate malicious code lends many benefits from both manual and automated analysis.
