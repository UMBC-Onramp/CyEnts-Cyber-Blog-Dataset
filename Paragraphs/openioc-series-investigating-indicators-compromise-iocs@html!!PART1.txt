The Back to Basics: OpenIOC blog series previously discussed how Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) can be used to codify information about malware or utilities and describe an attacker's methodology.
Also touched on were the parts of an IOC, such as the metadata, references, and definition sections.
This blog post will focus on writing IOCs by providing a common investigation scenario, following along with an incident response team as they investigate a compromise and assemble IOCs.
Our scenario involves a fictional organization, \"Acme Widgets Co.\", which designs, manufactures and distributes widgets.
