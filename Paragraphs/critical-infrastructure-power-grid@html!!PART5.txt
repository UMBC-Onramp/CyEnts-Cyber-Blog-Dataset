Who's up next?
State actors motivated to target critical infrastructure (by their own definition or the U.S.') won't just be the usual attention grabbers in cyberspace.
We estimate that Iran, Syria, and North Korea all have interest and would be able to conduct or direct some level of network operations.
These states are also likely to conduct operations in the near term to identify red lines and gauge corporate and government reactions.
With little reputational loss at stake, we expect actors sponsored by or associated with these states to target an array of critical infrastructure targets.
