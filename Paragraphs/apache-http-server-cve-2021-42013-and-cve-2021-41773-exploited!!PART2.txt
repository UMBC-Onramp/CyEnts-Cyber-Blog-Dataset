Attacks CVE-2021-42013 Attacks Let’s examine how these vulnerabilities can be exploited .
Vulnerability Details CVE-2021-41773 is a directory traversal vulnerability that was introduced as a result of a recent change to path normalization designed to improve performance in the URL validation in Apache http server 2.4.49.
It was found that if files outside the directories were not protected by the default configuration, “ require all denied”, the URL validation could be bypassed by the encoding character ‘.’.
It was also verified that the vulnerability could be used for remote code execution if mod_cgi is enabled.
PoCs that surfaced online used multiple variants to perform evasion for path traversal: /.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/ /.%2e%2f.%2e%2f
that decodes to: /../../ /.%2e/%2e%2e/
that decodes to: /../../
