Furthermore, we introduced the previously unknown Fire Chili rootkit and two compromised digital signatures, one of which we also directly linked to Winnti.
Although both Deep Panda and Winnti are known to use rootkits as part of their toolset, Fire Chili is a novel strain with a unique code base different from the ones previously affiliated with the groups.
The reason these tools are linked to two different groups is unclear at this time.
It’s possible that the groups’ developers shared resources, such as stolen certificates and C2 infrastructure, with each other.
This may explain why the samples were only signed several hours after being compiled.
