In this post, we continue our analysis of the SolarCity ConnectPort
X2e Zigbee device (referred to throughout as X2e device).
In Part One , we discussed the X2e at a high level, performed initial network-based attacks, then discussed the hardware techniques used to gain a remote shell on the X2e device as a non-privileged system user.
In this segment, weâ€™ll cover how we obtained a privileged shell on the device locally using power glitching attacks, and explore CVE-2020-12878 , a vulnerability we discovered that permitted remote privilege escalation to the root user.
Combined with CVE-2020-9306 (discussed in Part One), this would result in a complete remote compromise of the X2e device.
