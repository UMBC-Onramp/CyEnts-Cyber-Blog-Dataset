Before and after of switch statement groupings Isolated Subgraphs Running Edit -> Plugins -> SimplifyGraph brings up a new chooser named \"SimplifyGraph - Isolated subgraphs\" that begins showing what I call isolated subgraphs of the current graph, as seen in Figure 8.

Example isolated subgraphs chooser A full definition appears later in the appendix including how these are calculated, but the gist is that an isolated subgraph in a directed graph is a subset of nodes and edges such that there is a single entrance node, a single exit node, and none of the nodes (other than the subgraph entry node) is reachable by nodes not in the subgraph.
