Ensure that remote access authentication logs for each identified access platform are recorded, forwarded to a log aggregation utility, and retained for at least one year.
Whitelist IP address ranges that are confirmed as legitimate for remote access users based on baselining or physical location registrations.
If whitelisting is not possible, blacklist IP address ranges registered to physical locations or cloud hosting providers that should never legitimately authenticate to your remote access portal.
Utilize either SIEM capabilities or GeoLogonalyzer.py to perform GeoFeasibility analysis of all remote access on a regular frequency to establish a baseline of accounts that legitimately perform unexpected logon activity and identify new anomalies.
Investigating anomalies may require contacting the owner of the user account in question.
FireEye Helix analyzes live log data for all techniques utilized by GeoLogonalyzer, and more!
