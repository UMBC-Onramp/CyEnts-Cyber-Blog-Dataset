The threat actors sent a spear-phishing email with an attachment titled, “Malaysian Airlines MH370.doc” (MD5: 9c43a26fe4538a373b7f5921055ddeae).
Although threat actors often include some sort of “decoy content” upon successful exploitation (that is, a document representing what the recipient expected to open), in this case, the user is simply shown a blank document.
The attachment dropped a Poison Ivy variant into the path C:\\DOCUME~1\\admin\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\kav.exe (MD5: 9dbe491b7d614251e75fb19e8b1b0d0d), which, in turn, beaconed outbound to www.verizon.proxydns[.]com.
This Poison Ivy variant was configured with the connection password “wwwst@Admin.”
The APT group we refer to as Admin@338 has previously used Poison Ivy implants with this same password.
We document the Admin@338 group’s activities in our Poison Ivy: Assessing Damage and Extracting Intelligence paper.
