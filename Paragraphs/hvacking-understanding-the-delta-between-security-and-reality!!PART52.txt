What if the system could be controlled by an attacker while being undetected?
  
This scenario becomes more concerning considering the type of environments controlled by this device.
Normal Programming Controlling the standard functions of the device from just a root shell requires a much deeper understanding of how the device works in a normal setting.
Typically, the Delta eBMGR is programmed by an installer to perform a specific set of tasks.
These tasks can range from managing access control, to building lighting, to HVAC, and more.
Once programmed, the controller is connected to several external input/output (I/O) modules.
These modules are utilized for both controlling the state of an attached device and relaying information back to the manager.
To replicate these “normal conditions”, we had a professional installer program our device with a sample program and attach the appropriate modules.
Figure 27 shows how each component is connected in our sample programming.
  
For our initial testing, we did not actually have the large items such as the pump, boiler and heating valve.
