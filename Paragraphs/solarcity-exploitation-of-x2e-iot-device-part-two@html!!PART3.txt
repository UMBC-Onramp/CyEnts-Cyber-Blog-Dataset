Since we do not have root credentials, we put this thread on the backburner.
We have a full NAND dump of the Spansion raw flash, which includes boot configuration, bootloader firmware, filesystems, and the Linux kernel image.
This was used previously in Part One to obtain the hardcoded credential for the python user.
Knowing that UART is present and access to the bootloader would be extremely valuable, we decided to revisit that thread.
Gaining Privileged Access Locally Revisiting the Bootloader Figure 1 shows the U-Boot boot process displayed while connected via UART connection.
In some cases, it is possible to send keyboard input to the device during a set period (usually one to four seconds) when the bootloader presents the message, “Hit any key to stop autoboot,” which interrupts the boot process and drops the user into a U-Boot shell.
