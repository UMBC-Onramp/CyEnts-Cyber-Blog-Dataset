Ransom Demands Increasing The fact that ransom demands are increasing isnâ€™t a coincidence.
Per Bloomberg, the average ransom demand increased to somewhere between $50 million and $70 million over the first half of 2021.
Even so, ransomware victims only ended up paying between $10 million and $15 million on average.
The reality is that victims like the U.S. insurance company discussed above succeed in negotiating the ransom payment down.
Not only that, but many victims have cyber insurance policies that cover some, if not all, of the cost of paying a ransom.
Ransomware actors understand that many of their victims have cyber insurers paying with or for them.
