The Lua engine is expected to be sandboxed , i.e., clients can interact with the Redis APIs from Lua, but should not be able to execute arbitrary code on the machine where Redis is running.
“ – Reginaldo Silva In January 2022, Reginaldo Silva discovered a vulnerability in Redis (Debian-specific) that allows Lua sandbox escape.
A remote attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary Lua scripts could escape the Lua sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host.
This vulnerability existed because the Lua library in some Debian/Ubuntu packages is provided as a dynamic library (Ubuntu Bionic and Trusty are not affected).
When the Lua interpreter initializes, the “ package ” variable is automatically populated, and that in turn permitted access to arbitrary Lua functionality.
