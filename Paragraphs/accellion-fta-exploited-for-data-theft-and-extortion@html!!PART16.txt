In at least one case, UNC2582 also sent emails  to partners of the victim organization that included links to the stolen data and negotiation chat.
Monitoring of the CL0P^_- LEAKS shaming website has demonstrated that UNC2582 has followed through on threats to publish stolen data as several new victims have appeared on the site in recent weeks, including at least one organization that has publicly confirmed that their Accellion FTA device had been recently targeted.
Key Overlaps With FIN11 UNC2582 (Extortion) and FIN11 Mandiant identified overlaps between UNC2582’s data theft extortion activity and prior FIN11 operations, including common email senders and the use of the CL0P^_- LEAKS shaming site.
While FIN11 is known for deploying CLOP ransomware, we have previously observed the group conduct data theft extortion without ransomware deployment, similar to these cases.
Some UNC2582 extortion emails observed in January 2021 were sent from IP addresses and/or email accounts used by FIN11 in multiple phishing campaigns between August and December 2020, including some of the last campaigns that were clearly attributable to the group.
We have not observed FIN11 phishing activity in the new year.
FIN11 has typically paused their phishing operations over the winter holidays and had several extended gaps in their operations.
