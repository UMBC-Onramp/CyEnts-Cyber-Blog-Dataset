BLOODBANK takes advantage of a legitimate process that supports Single Sign On functionality and looks for plaintext passwords when they are briefly loaded in memory.
The utility parses the following two files containing password hashes or plaintext passwords: /home/runtime/mtmp/lmdb/data0/data.mdb /home/runtime/mtmp/system BLOODBANK expects an output file as a command line parameter, otherwise it prints file open error.
