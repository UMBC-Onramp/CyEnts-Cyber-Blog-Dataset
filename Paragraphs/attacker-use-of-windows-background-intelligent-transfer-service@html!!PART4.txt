Creating BitsParser Through our investigations, Mandiant consultants identified evidence of attackers leveraging BITS across multiple campaigns.
In order to search for evidence of attacker use of BITS, we needed to understand the underlying infrastructure used by BITS and create a tool that could collect relevant information.
We created BitsParser , which parses BITS databases and returns information about jobs executed on endpoint systems.
