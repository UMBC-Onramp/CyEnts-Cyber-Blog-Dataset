I will be blogging on each of the six trends over the next two weeks; you can even view the videos we've developed for each trend as each blog post is published:
Malware Only Tells Half the Story .
Of the many systems compromised in each investigation, about half of them were never touched by attacker malware.
In so many cases, the intruders logged into systems and took data from them (or used them as a staging point for exfiltration), but didn't install tools.
It is ironic that the very systems that hold the data targeted by an attacker are probably the least likely to have malware installed on them.
While finding the malware used in an intrusion is important, it is impossible to understand the full scope of an intrusion if this is the focal point of the investigation.
