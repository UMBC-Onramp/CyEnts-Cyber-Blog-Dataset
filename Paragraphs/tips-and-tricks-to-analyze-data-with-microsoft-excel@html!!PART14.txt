Note the use of \"$\" to ensure that the start and end of the range are an absolute reference and are not automatically updated by Excel if we copy this formula to other cells.
B2
This is the cell that contains the value we want to search for and count occurrences of in our range of $B$2:$B$25.
Â Note that this parameter is not an absolute reference with a preceding \"$\".
This allows us to fill the formula down through all rows and ensure that we are counting the applicable user name.
To summarize, this formula will search the username column of all logon data and count how many times the user of each logon has logged on in total across all data points.
When most user accounts log on regularly, a compromised account being used to logon for the first time may clearly stand out when reviewing total log on counts.
If we have a specific time frame in mind, it may be helpful to know which accounts first logged on during that time.
