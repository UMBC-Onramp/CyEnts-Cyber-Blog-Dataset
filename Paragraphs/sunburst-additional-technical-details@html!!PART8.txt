The list of hashes and their corresponding strings can be viewed at this FireEye GitHub page .
SUNBURST uses the aforementioned FNV-1A plus XOR algorithm to compute the hash of each process name, service name, and driver filename on the system.
If a blocklisted process or driver name is found, SUNBURST pauses and tries again later.
The backdoor continues past this check only when there are no processes nor drivers from the blocklist present.
If a blocklisted service is found, SUNBURST attempts to disable the blocklisted service by manipulating the service configuration in the Windows Registry.
It sets the registry value HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\<service_name>\\Start to the value 4 , which corresponds to SERVICE_DISABLED .
