When a user needs access to a TGT or service ticket, the ticket is retrieved from the database, decrypted, and then passed to the remote service (for more on SSSD, check out this great research from Portcullis Labs ).
By default, SSSD maintains a copy of the database at the path /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb.
The corresponding key is stored as a hidden file at the path /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey.
By default, the key is only readable if you have root permissions.
If a user is able to extract both of these files, it is possible to decrypt the files offline and obtain valid Kerberos tickets.
