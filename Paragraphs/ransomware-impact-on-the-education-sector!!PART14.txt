The exploit was subsequently used in notorious Wannacry and notPetya attacks. .
The machines that contacted the  the malicious URLs may have downloaded and installed the Glupteba malware.
Glupteba then exploitedEternalBlue to distribute DoublePulsar, a backdoor  implant disclosed by ShadowBrokers that enables the execution of additional malicious code.
That scenario provides good explanation why the Backdoor.
DouplePulsar signature was triggered.
The detection was most observed in Brazil, South Africa, and India, which account for 70% of the total Backdoor.
DouplePulsar detections triggered.
Botnet and AV Detections in the Education Sector
Next, we compared Botnet activities observed in the US and worldwide to find trends.
They turned out to be almost in sync.
Unlike IPS triggers, which record blocked attacks, botnet detections indicate active botnet malware within a network.
The Mirai IoT botnet led both regions, followed by Gh0st Rat and Zeroaccess.
Together, they account for more than 50% of the botnet activities in the US and global education sectors.
