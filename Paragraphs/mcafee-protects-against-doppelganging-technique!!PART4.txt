In contrast to adversaries who can release mistakes in code and implementation, we simply cannot.
We have to thoroughly test to ensure that when we release our solution it detects correctly and does not disrupt or break other software.
McAfee’s Product Security Incident Team (PSIRT), working in coordination with McAfee’s product teams 1 delivered a protection to Process Doppelgänging in two of McAfee’s product suites (see below for more detail).
McAfee’s protection has tested effective against EnSilo’s original proof of concept (PoC) and other examples.
As an example, we tested recent malware using the technique against our detection feature with success: McAfee’s protection prevents execution of a file if changes to it are contained within a Windows NTFS transaction.
There are no legitimate uses for the Transactional API to be used in this way, so far as McAfee know.
Details of products that include protection against Process Doppelgänging follow: ENS 10.5.4, released April 24, 2018 VSE 8.8 patch 11, released April 24, 2018 ENS 10.6, Public Beta available March 9, 2018.
Release is targeted around June 1, 2018 WSS 16.0.12 will include the same protection.
  Release of WSS is targeted for the end of May, or the beginning of June, 2018.
What Is Protected Windows 7 & 8 -> McAfee protection is effective Win 10 RS3 -> McAfee protection is effective Win 10 RS4 -> Microsoft has implemented the same protection as McAfee EnSilo have documented that attempts to exploit Win 10 Pre RS3 results in a Windows crash, “Blue Screen of Death” (BSOD).
