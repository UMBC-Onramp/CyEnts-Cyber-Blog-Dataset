As its gaming population has steadily grown, reaching more than 140 million monthly active players in August 2021, Minecraft has never been more popular 12 years after its initial release.
Evidently, cybercriminals cannot pass up the opportunity to target such a large userbase.
FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a variant of the Chaos ransomware that appears to target Minecraft gamers in Japan.
This variant not only encrypts certain files but also destroys others, rendering them unrecoverable.
If gamers fall prey to the attack, choosing to pay the ransom may still lead to a loss of data.
In this report we will take a look at how this new ransomware variant works.
Ransomware Lure Being Posted to Japanese Minecraft Forums Gamers create “alt” (alternative) accounts within Minecraft for various purposes (both good and bad): they allow them to antagonize/troll other players without having their main account banned, they provide cover for an alternative in-game identity/personality, they help avoid getting their main account banned for using cheats (gaining an unfair advantage over other gamers), etc.
FortiGuard Labs has discovered a variant of Chaos ransomware being hidden in a file pretending to contain a list of “Minecraft Alt” accounts that leads us to believe that the effort is to target Minecraft gamers in Japan.
