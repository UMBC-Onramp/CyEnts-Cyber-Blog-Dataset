This means R12 is often used as a general-purpose register within subroutines indicating it is almost certainly safe to clobber for our purposes without experiencing unexpected adverse effects.
Piecing Everything Together With a firm understanding of the vulnerability, exploit, and the shellcode needed we could now attempt exploitation.
Looking at the sequence of packets used to cause this attack, it is not a single packet attack, but a multiple packet attack.
The initial buffer overflow is contained in the large malformed packet, so what data do we build into it?
This packet is overwriting memory but not providing control over execution; therefore, this can be considered the “setup” or “staging” packet.
This is where memcpy will look for the address of the destination buffer for our last packet.
The address we want to overwrite goes in this packet followed by our shellcode.
As explained above, the address we are looking to overwrite is the address of the scDecodeBACnetUDP function pointer in the GOT minus one, to ensure the address isn’t 4-byte aligned.
By repairing the last byte of the previous function pointer and overwriting this address, we can gain execution control.
