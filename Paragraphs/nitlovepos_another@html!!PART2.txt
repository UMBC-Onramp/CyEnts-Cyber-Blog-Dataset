Propagation We have been monitoring an indiscriminate spam campaign that started on Wednesday, May 20, 2015.
  
The spam emails referred to possible employment opportunities and purported to have a resume attached.
The “From” email addresses were spoofed Yahoo!
Mail accounts and contained the following “Subject” lines:
Subject: Any Jobs?
Subject:
Any openings?
Subject:
Internship Subject:
Internship questions Subject: Internships?
Subject:
Job Posting Subject: Job questions Subject: My Resume Subject: Openings?
The email came with an attachment named CV_[4 numbers].doc or My_Resume_[4 numbers].doc , which is embedded with a malicious macro.
To trick the recipient into enabling the malicious macro, the document claims to be a “protected document.”
