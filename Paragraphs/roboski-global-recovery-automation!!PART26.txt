In addition to being hex-encoded, the .NET
Microsoft resource name and base XOR key are Base64 encoded.
A .NET obfuscator is leveraged to encrypt all strings in the RoboSki packer, inhibiting the ability to easily extract the resource name and base XOR key.
All 55 RoboSki packer samples contained the same RoboSki decryption component.
After updating the parser module(s) to support the variations observed in the RoboSki packer, approximately 1,300 additional RoboSki packer samples were obtained via VirusTotal and subsequently run against the capability.
