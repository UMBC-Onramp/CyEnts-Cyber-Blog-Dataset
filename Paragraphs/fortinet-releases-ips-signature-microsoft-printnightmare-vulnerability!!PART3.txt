After their proof-of-concept was disclosed, QiAnXin noticed, on June 21 st , that Microsoft had changed the title of the vulnerability, which was initially identified as only being exploitable locally, to reflect this remote code execution aspect.
They also changed the vulnerability status from its original designation (high severity, privilege escalation) to critical severity, remote code execution.
Adding to the confusion, Microsoft's current (as of this post) write-up for CVE-2021-1675 still states that it is a local vulnerability.
Compounding the risk to organizations further, threat researchers at Sangfor Security, working independently and in parallel with QiAnXin, had developed their own working proof-of-concept code, which they posted to Github this past Tuesday (June 29th).
While this detailed proof-of-concept has since been taken down, multiple cached copies still exist.
Â It can be reasonably expected that bad actors will potentially leverage this information for future attacks.
