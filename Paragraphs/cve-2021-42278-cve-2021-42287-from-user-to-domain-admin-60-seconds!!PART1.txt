FortiGuard Labs ThreatÂ Research Report Affected Platforms: Windows Impacted Users: Any organization with an Active Directory environment Impact: Unprivileged user can escalate privileges to domain administrator Severity Level:
Critical On Patch Tuesday of last November, Microsoft released advisories to address several vulnerabilities in Active-Directory.
Analysis of these vulnerabilities showed that by combining CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287 it is possible, under default conditions, for a regular user to easily impersonate a domain admin.
This means that any domain user can effectively become a domain administrator, which makes these vulnerabilities extremely severe.
Moreover, there are already several Github repositories with free-to-use PoC code that facilitates the exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
