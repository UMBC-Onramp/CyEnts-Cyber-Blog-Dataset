For the attacker, this was a relatively straightforward process since the ransomware spreads itself.
The deployment of the ransomware on one single host remotely instructed the other hosts in the network to run the following PowerShell command: Figure 2: PowerShell execution to download LockBit
This command retrieves a .png file from a website that has probably been compromised.
There are two versions of the .png file, one for .NET version 4 and one for version 3.5.
The PowerShell command checks which version it needs by getting the version number of the common language runtime that is running the current process.
If this starts with ‘V4’, the .png for version 4 is downloaded; otherwise it downloads the .png for version 3.5 via the URLs below: https://espet[.]se/images/rs35.png https://espet[.]se/images/rs40.png What is interesting in this case is that each distinct host downloads the ransomware itself.
