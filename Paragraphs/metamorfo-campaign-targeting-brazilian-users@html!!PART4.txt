Contents of Decoded VBS Figure 6: More Contents of Decoded VBS The downloaded ZIP file contains four files.
Two are PE files.
One is a legitimate Windows tool, pvk2pfx.exe, that is abused for DLL side-loading.
One is the malicious banking Trojan as the DLL.
The VBS code unzips the archive, changes the extension of the legitimate Windows tool from .png
 to .exe, and renames the malicious DLL as cryptui.dll.
The VBS code also creates a file in C:\\Users\\Public\\Administrador\\car.dat with random strings.
