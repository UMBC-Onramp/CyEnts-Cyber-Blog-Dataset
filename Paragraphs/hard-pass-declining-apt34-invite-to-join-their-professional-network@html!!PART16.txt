VALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the operator to extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault.
Additionally, VALUEVAULT will call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match browser passwords with visited sites.
A snippet of this function is shown in Figure 6.
