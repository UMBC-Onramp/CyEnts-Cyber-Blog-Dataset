Moving forward it would be reasonable to anticipate additional frameworks, such as TRITON, designed for usage against other SIS controllers and associated technologies.
If Triconex was within scope, we may see similar attacker methodologies affecting the dominant industrial safety technologies.
Basic security measures do little to thwart truly persistent threat actors and monitoring only IT networks is not an ideal situation.
Visibility into both the IT and OT environments is critical for detecting the various stages of an ICS intrusion.
Simple detection concepts such as baseline deviation can provide insight into abnormal activity.
While the TRITON framework was actively in use, how many traditional ICS “alarms” were set off while the actors tested their exploits and backdoors on the Triconex controller?
How many times did the TriStation protocol, as implemented in their Python scripts, fail or cause errors because of non-standard traffic?
How many TriStation UDP pings were sent and how many Connection Requests?
How did these statistics compare to the baseline for TriStation traffic?
