         Critical A phishing campaign was recently caught in the wild by Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs , that delivers a malicious Microsoft PowerPoint file.
The content of the phishing email,  written in Korean, asks recipients to open the attached PowerPoint file to review a purchase order.
I researched what this malicious file does once the PowerPoint file is opened and have been able to confirm that it is spreading a new variant of Agent Tesla.
