How to protect yourself from Spring4Shell
The main advice for anyone who uses the Spring framework is to upgrade to secure versions 5.3.18 or 5.2.20.
The Apache Software Foundation has also released patched versions of Apache Tomcat 10.0.20, 9.0.62, and 8.5.78, in which the attack vector is closed on the Tomcat side.
The Spring developers have also released patched versions of the Spring Boot 2.5.12 and 2.6.6 extensions that depend on the patched version of Spring Framework 5.3.18.
If for some reason you cannot update the above software, then you should use one of the workarounds published on the official Spring website.
