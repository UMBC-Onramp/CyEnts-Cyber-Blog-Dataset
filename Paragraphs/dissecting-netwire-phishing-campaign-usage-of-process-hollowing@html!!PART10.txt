Figure 9: Windows APIs used in .NET dropper for process hollowing After reversing and modifying the code of the C# dropper to invoke R from main, we were able to confirm that when the method R is invoked, InstallUtil.exe is spawned in suspended mode.
The memory blocks of the suspended process are unmapped and rewritten with the sections of the payload program passed as an argument to method R.
The thread is allowed to continue after changes have been made to the entry point.
When the process hollowing is complete, the parent PowerShell process is terminated.
