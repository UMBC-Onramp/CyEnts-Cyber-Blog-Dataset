PowerShell script to slip by Windows Defender.
One of my favorite PowerShell commands is iex (new-objectnet.webclient).downloadstring, which can be used to load a remotely hosted script directly into memory.
This command is often behind reports of “fileless” malware and is regularly abused by red teams and criminals alike.
AV detection of this method has improved somewhat recently but plenty of options exist to evade, such as invoke-obfuscation by @danielhbohannon .
The MITRE ATT&CK framework includes a technique called “Indicator Removal from Tools” ( T1066 ), which describes how an adversary may alter a tool after it is detected in an attempt to evade defenses.
T1066 is one reason why alerts for a tool being blocked should not be ignored.
In researching this technique, I found that using my favorite command with PowerSploit’s Find-AVSignature.ps1 somewhat ironically resulted in a Windows Defender block… not-so-ironically, it was released in 2012.
There have been many excellent posts on how to evade AV but, as the saying goes, “there is more than one way to skin a cat.”
 To highlight how ridiculous AV can be, I decided to bypass AV detection of Find-AVSignature.ps1 while maintaining the spirit of “there is an easier way,” outlined in @obscuresec ’s blog post introducing Find-AvSignature.
The key to my method is PowerShell’s built-in Invoke-Webrequest command (also known by the aliases \"iwr,\" \"wget,\" and \"curl\").
