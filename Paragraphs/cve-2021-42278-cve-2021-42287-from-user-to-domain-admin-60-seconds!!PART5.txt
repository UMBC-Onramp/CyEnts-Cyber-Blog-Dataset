The vulnerability can be triggered in a scenario where a user obtains a TGT, the user gets removed, and the previously obtained TGT is used to request a service ticket for another user for themselves—basically, S4U2self.
In this case, the user will not be found and a lookup for the user with appended “$” will be executed.
