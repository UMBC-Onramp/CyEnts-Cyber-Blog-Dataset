As in previous variants, Shamoon Version 3 installs a malicious service that runs the wiper component.
Once the wiper is running, it overwrites all files with random rubbish and triggers a reboot, resulting in a “blue screen of death” or a driver error and making the system inoperable.
The variant can also enumerate the local network, but in this case does nothing with that information.
This variant has some bugs, suggesting the possibility that this version is a beta or test phase.
The main differences from earlier versions are the name list used to drop the malicious file and the fabricated service name MaintenaceSrv (with “maintenance” misspelled).
The wiping component has also been designed to target all files on the system with these options: Overwrite file with garbage data (used in this version and the samples we analyzed) Overwrite with a file (used in Shamoon Versions 1 and 2) Encrypt the files and master boot record (not used in this version)
