To avoid the inadvertent triggering of such commands during the regular operation of IDA Pro, these commands are only active when the “input mode” is enabled.
This mode is enabled automatically when certain commands are activated such as “rename” or “find”, and automatically disabled when dialog commands such as “OK” or “cancel” are activated.
The input mode can also be manually manipulated with the “input mode on” and “input mode off” commands.
Conclusion Today, the FLARE team is releasing a profile for VoiceAttack and a companion IDAPython plugin that enables full voice control of IDA Pro along with many added convenience features.
The profile contains over 1000 defined commands and growing.
It is easy to view, edit, and add commands to this profile to customize it to suit your needs or to improve it for the community at large.
The VoiceAttack software is highly affordable and enables you to create profiles for any applications or games that you use.
For installation instructions and usage information, see the project’s Github page .
