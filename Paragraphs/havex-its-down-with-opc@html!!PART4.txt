We leveraged the OPC Server and libraries from St4makers [2] (as shown in Figure 2).
This software is available for free to SCADA engineers to allow them to develop software to communicate information to and from SCADA devices.
Figure 2: OPC Server Setup Using the OPC Server libraries allowed us to make the Arduino Uno act as a true, functioning OPC SCADA device (Figure 3).
Figure 3:
Matrikon OPC Explorer showing Arduino OPC Server We also used Matrikonâ€™s OPC Explorer [1] , which enables browsing between the Arduino OPC server and the Matrikon embedded simulation OPC server.
