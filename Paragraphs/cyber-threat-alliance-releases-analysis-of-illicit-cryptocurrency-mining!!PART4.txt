Monero has several advantages over Bitcoin in terms of privacy and anonymity; this makes it a favorite among bad actors.
Beyond anonymity concerns, resources required to mine Monero are significantly lower, enabling more users to participate and increasing the profitability of botnets.
The act of generating the coin is called mining, which is using system resources to solve a complex mathematical problem.
Most major coins employ a “proof of work” that uses CPU resources to solve.
Large groups of miners, including botnets, can amass their resources, called pool mining, on a single problem.
The mining operations result in a solved mathematical equation that returns newly minted coins to the system and validates new transactions.
The State of Illicit Cryptocurrency Mining Current incidents of illicit cryptomining occur through compiled executables.
This practice is called binary-based mining.
In the context of the browser, the practice is called browser-based mining.
Binary-based cryptomining malware is delivered as a payload, often using spam or exploit kits.
Open-source tools often facilitate mining.
