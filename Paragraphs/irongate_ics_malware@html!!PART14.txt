Examination of the executable from that blogâ€™s demo code shows that the WriteInputPoint function calls with byte indices 0x110 and 0x114 set pressure and temperature values, respectively: IRONGATE:
WriteInputPoint(0x110, 0, 0x7763) WriteInputPoint(0x114, 0, 0x7763)
Equivalent pseudo code from Biogas.exe: S7ProSim.
WriteInputPoint(0x110, 0, (short)this.
Pressure.
Value) S7ProSim.
WriteInputPoint(0x114, 0, (short)this.
Temperature.
Value)
We have been unable to determine the significance of the hardcoded value 0x7763 , which is passed in both instances of the write function.
