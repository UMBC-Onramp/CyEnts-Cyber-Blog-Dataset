Itâ€™s interesting to note at this point the architecture of the WOW64 layer.
From the perspective of the 64-bit kernel the execution of 32-bit (Wow64) usermode applications is essentially a big while loop.
The loop executes x86 instructions in the processor's 32-bit execution mode and occasionally exits the loop to service a system call.
Because the kernel is 64-bit, the processor mode is temporarily switched to 64-bit, the system call serviced, then the mode switched back and the loop continued where it was paused.
One could say the WOW64 layer acts like an emulator where the instructions are instead executed on the physical CPU.
