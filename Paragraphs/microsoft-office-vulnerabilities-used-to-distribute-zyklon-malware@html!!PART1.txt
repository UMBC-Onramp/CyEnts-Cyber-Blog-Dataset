Introduction FireEye researchers recently observed threat actors leveraging relatively new vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office to spread Zyklon HTTP malware.
Zyklon has been observed in the wild since early 2016 and provides myriad sophisticated capabilities.
Zyklon is a publicly available, full-featured backdoor capable of keylogging, password harvesting, downloading and executing additional plugins, conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and self-updating and self-removal.
The malware may communicate with its command and control (C2) server over The Onion Router (Tor) network if configured to do so.
The malware can download several plugins, some of which include features such as cryptocurrency mining and password recovery, from browsers and email software.
