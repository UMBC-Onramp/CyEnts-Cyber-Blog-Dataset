Anti VM Checks
The malware searches for a series of hooked modules, specific filenames and paths, and known sandbox volume serial numbers, including: sbiedll.dll, dir_watch.dll, api_log.dll, dbghelp.dll, Frz_State, C:\\popupkiller.exe, C:\\stimulator.exe, C:\\TOOLS\\execute.exe, \\sand-box\\, \\cwsandbox\\, \\sandbox\\, 0CD1A40, 6CBBC508, 774E1682, 837F873E, 8B6F64BC.
Aside from the aforementioned checks and blacklisting, there is also a wait option built in where the payload will delay execution on an infected machine before it launches an encryption routine.
This technique was likely implemented to further avoid detection within sandbox environments.
Persistence Once executed, Cerber deploys the following persistence techniques to make sure a system remains infected: A registry key is added to launch the malware instead of the screensaver when the system becomes idle.
The “CommandProcessor” Autorun keyvalue is changed to point to the Cerber payload so that the malware will be launched each time the Windows terminal, “cmd.exe”, is launched.
