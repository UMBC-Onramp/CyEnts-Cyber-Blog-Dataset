It should be noted that AI models are not static; they are routinely updated with new information to make them more accurate.
This constant model training frequently leaves them vulnerable to manipulation.
Companies should remain vigilant and regularly audit their training data to eliminate poisoned inputs.
Additionally, where applicable, AI applications should incorporate human supervision to ensure that erroneous outputs or recommendations do not automatically result in financial disruption.
AI's inherent limitations also pose a problem as the financial sector increasingly adopts these applications for their operations.
The lack of transparency in how a model arrived at its answer is problematic for analysts who are using AI recommendations to conduct trades.
Without an explanation for its output , it is difficult to determine liability when a trade has negative outcomes.
This lack of clarity can lead analysts to mistrust an application and eventually refrain from using it altogether.
Additionally, the rise of data privacy laws may also accelerate the need for explainable AI in the financial sector.
Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) stipulates that companies employing AI applications must have an explanation for decisions made by its models .
Some financial institutions have begun addressing this explainability problem by developing AI models that are inherently more transparent.
Researchers have also developed self-explaining neural networks , which provide understandable explanations for the outputs generated by the system.
