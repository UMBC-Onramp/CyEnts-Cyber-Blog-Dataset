Building Features Next, we had to start building features.
This is where the fun began.
Looking at dozens and dozens of PDB paths, we simply started recording various things that ‘pop out’ to an analyst.
As noted earlier, a file path contains tons of implicit information, beyond simply being a string-based artifact.
Some analogies we have found useful is that a file path is more akin to a geographical location in its representation of a location on the file system, or like a sentence in that it reflects a series of dependent items.
