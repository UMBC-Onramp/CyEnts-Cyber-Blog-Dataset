The Syrian Electronic Army has made news for its recent attacks on major communications websites , Forbes , and an alleged attack on CENTCOM .
While these attacks garnered public attention, the activities of another group - The Syrian Malware Team - have gone largely unnoticed.
The groupâ€™s activities prompted us to take a closer look.
We discovered this group using a .NET based RAT called BlackWorm to infiltrate their targets.
The Syrian Malware Team is largely pro-Syrian government, as seen in one of their banners featuring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Based on the sentiments publicly expressed by this group it is likely that they are either directly or indirectly involved with the Syrian government.
Further certain members of the Syrian Malware Team have ties to the Syrian Electronic army (SEA) known to be linked to the Syrian government .
This indicates that the Syrian Malware Team may also be possibly an offshoot or part of the SEA.
