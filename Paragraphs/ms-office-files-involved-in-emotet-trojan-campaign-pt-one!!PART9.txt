And “switch_number” is modified each time after being used, then once the code branch task is finished it goes back to the “while” statement to check the “switch_number” again.
This technique really causes trouble for security researchers trying to analyze the function’s intention and trace its code.
Figure 4.1 is a pseudo code in C that reveals the obfuscated code flow.
Strings are Encrypted All constant strings are encrypted and are only decrypted just before being used.
The constant strings are usually very useful hints for researchers to quickly locate the key point of the malware.
