This search order provides a Windows application with a list of locations where it can find a valid DLL or libraries.
The application then uses the DLL that is available, whichever comes first.
When the application executes it then loads the malicious DLL if it is available first rather than the valid DLL.
However, this ransomware does a little more than that.
Instead of just dropping the malicious “mpsvc.dll”, it also drops the valid application, MsMpEng.exe.
