The sample embeds the usage information: usage: /home
/bin/bash clear_log.sh [logfile] [keyword(regex)] LOCKPICK
The file libcrypto.so (SHA256: 2610d0372e0e107053bc001d278ef71f08562e5610691f18b978123c499a74d8 ) is a shared object containing cryptographic logic from openssl.
The sample contains a modification to the routine bnrand_range that breaks the security of the random numbers generated.
There are three paths in this routine for generating a random big number between a given range.
The first case is unmodified and generates a zeroed big number, the other two cases are patched so that a constant value overwrites the generated random value and always returns success.
This breaks the random number generation by replacing it with a value the attacker knows in all cases.
LOCKPICK
Patcher The file with the hash b990f79ce80c24625c97810cb8f161eafdcb10f1b8d9d538df4ca9be387c35e4 is a patcher utility responsible for inserting the malicious logic known as LOCKPICK.
The patcher starts by running sed on the integrity checker script built into the appliance to insert an early exit routine.
This is inserted by the command sed -i '12aexit 0' /home/bin/check_integrity.sh which when applied causes this script to exit without performing its intended checks.
