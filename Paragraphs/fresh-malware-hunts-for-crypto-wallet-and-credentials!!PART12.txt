Collect Other Saved Credentials Other than the browsers identified above, this malware also collects saved credentials from other installed software clients, including Outlook, CoreFTP, FileZilla, NordVPN, FoxMail, Thunderbird, and similar browsers such as Firefox, Waterfox, K-Meleon, Cyberfox, and BlackHawk.

Each group of credentials consists of URL, Username, Password, and Application.
Each group of the credentials is split by “=============================”.
