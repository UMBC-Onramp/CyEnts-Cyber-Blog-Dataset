The Implications
Whether the objective behind the threat is disruption or financial gain, these attacks all do have one thing in common — they impact the overall feeling of safety at these events and take away from what is supposed to feel like a worldwide celebration of sport.
Now, when fans wish to part of a big event such as the World Cup, they can no longer just focus on which jersey they’re wearing that day.
They have to worry about their bank accounts being robbed or becoming extorted.
Beyond the individual implications, the nation-state attacks that take place at these events can rear their head in an ugly way, as they can actually worsen international relations much more than a healthy sporting rivalry ever could.
