The SAML token issued by AD FS proves a user’s identity to Microsoft 365 and can also be used to make authorization decisions.
The SAML token is an XML document with two main components: Assertions : Assertions are XML elements that describe the user’s identity.
An assertion could be a user SID, group membership SIDs, or other elements like the user’s department name.
A single SAML token can have multiple assertions attached to it.
Digital Signature : The assertions in the SAML token are digitally signed using a public/private keypair that resides on the AD FS server.
