In December 2017, researchers with Kaspersky Labs reported on a new multi-faceted Android malware capable of a variety of actions including mining cryptocurrencies and launching DDoS attacks.
The resource load created by the malware has reportedly been high enough that it can cause the battery to bulge and physically destroy the device.
The malware, dubbed Loapi, is unique in the breadth of its potential actions.
It has a modular framework that includes modules for malicious advertising, texting, web crawling, Monero mining, and other activities.
