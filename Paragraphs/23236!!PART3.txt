The strange address of the link lurking under the button, which looks nothing like luno.com and is located in the .ar domain zone (Argentina), might arouse suspicion.
If the victim doesnâ€™t notice this discrepancy and simply clicks, the link takes them through a chain of redirects to an illegitimate Luno login page.
The fake resource is very similar in design to the real Luno site, but the cybercriminals did not even try to disguise the URL, apparently counting on user carelessness.
