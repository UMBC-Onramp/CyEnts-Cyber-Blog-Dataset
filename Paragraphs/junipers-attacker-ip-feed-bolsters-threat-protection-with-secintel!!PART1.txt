Juniper Threat Labs (JTL) has a network of sensors throughout the world that we use to monitor cyber security threats.
These threats can range from Brute Force attacks against logins, such as SSH, FTP, telnet and RDP, to more sophisticated attacks against SMB, Citrix and databases.

The JTL sensors are designed to mimic the majority of common operating systems currently on the internet in both up-to-date patched and unpatched systems.
