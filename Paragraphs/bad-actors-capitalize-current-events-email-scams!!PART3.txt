The zipped attachment contains a file, “W-9 form.
XLM.”
The XLM extension is simply an Excel file that contains Excel 4.0 macros: For those not familiar with Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification), it is used by U.S. individuals to provide a correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) to payers (or brokers) who are required to file information returns with the IRS.
Red flags that this is a phishing scam include the non-capitalization of “assistant” and the incorrect usage of “Treasure” instead of “Treasury” in the signature body.
It should also be noted that the IRS does not communicate with U.S. taxpayers via email and instead uses the traditional postal service for all communications.
Analysis Upon observation, and in a similar fashion to our recent Emotet blog , the XLM file asks the user to enable macros upon opening the file.
