Instead of wrestling with this feature to try to make it work for this purpose, a very large and growing collection of “input recognition” commands was created.
These commands are designed to recognize common words used in the names of functions and variables, as well as full function names as found in the C runtime libraries and the Windows APIs.
Once recognized, the word or function name is copied to the user’s clipboard and pasted into the text field.
