After the Domain Controller validates the request, a service ticket is issued that will authenticate the user to the CIFS (SMB) service on SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP.
The user receives the service ticket from the Domain Controller and initiates an SMB negotiation with SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP.
During the authentication process, the user provides a Kerberos blob inside an “AP-REQ” structure that includes the service ticket previously obtained.
