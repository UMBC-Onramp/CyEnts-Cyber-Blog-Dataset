In this blog, we will examine details of this attack as well as the infrastructure they used.
The reader will see the multi-step process used to ensure that the target would be infected, including evasive steps to bypass detection technologies via the .XLL file extension and the use of a valid signed digital certificate.
What Exactly is an XLL File Extension?
An XLL file extension is used by Excel Add-in files to allow third party applications to add extra functionality to Excel.
XLL files are similar in structure to DLL files.
They allow for calls of specific Excel commands, worksheet functions from Visual Basic (VBA), registered XLL commands, and from functions referenced in Excel.
The use of XLL files is not as common as a maliciously crafted XLS file that contain macros or exploits, so it is a rarely observed evasion tactic used by threat actors to bypass endpoint detection.
Complicating things even further, the malicious XLL file used in this campaign (at the time of analysis) is signed with a valid digital signature and chained accordingly.
