This can potentially bypass application whitelisting since all processes spawned during the attack are legitimate Microsoft executables.
Technical Details
The initial document contains VBScript code.
When the user opens it, Wscript is spawned by iexplore to execute this file.
The script uses multiple layers of obfuscation to bypass static scanners, and ultimately runs a PowerShell script for executing the binary payload.
Obfuscation techniques used during different levels of script execution are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.
Figure 3:
Type 1 obfuscation technique, which uses log functions to resolve a wide character Figure 4:
Type 2 obfuscation technique, which uses split and replace operations This script then downloads and executes another encoded .vbs
script from a paste.ee URL, as seen in Figure 5.
Paste.ee is a less regulated alternative to Pastebin and we have seen multiple attacks using this service to host the payload.
Since the website uses TLS, most firewall solutions cannot detect the malicious content being downloaded over the network.
