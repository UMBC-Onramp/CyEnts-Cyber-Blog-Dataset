Soldering pins to each of the unpopulated headers and using a logic analyzer, we determined that the 4-pin header in the center of the board is a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) header running at a baud rate of 115200.
Figure 3 Using the Exodus XI Breakout board (shout out to @Logan_Brown and the Exodus team) to connect to the UART headers, we were met with an unprotected root prompt on the system.
Now with full access to the system, we could start to gain a deeper understanding of how the system works and extract the firmware.
Figure 4 Firmware Extraction and System Analysis With the UART interface, we could now explore the system in real-time, but how could we extract the firmware for offline analysis?
The device has two USB ports which we were able to use to mount a USB drive.
This allowed us to copy what is running in memory using dd onto a flash drive, effectively extracting the firmware.
