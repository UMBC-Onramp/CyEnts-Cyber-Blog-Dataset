Download requests are captured in the FTAâ€™s web logs, which will contain requests to the DEWMODE web shell with encrypted and encoded URL parameters, where dwn is the file path and fn is the requested file name (Figure 5).
The encrypted file path and name values visible in web logs can be decrypted using key material obtained from the database used by the targeted FTA.
Given the complex nature of this process, if your organization needs assistance reviewing relevant logs, please contact Mandiant or Accellion.
