The identity model has shifted from user centric in traditional IT systems to machine centric for IoT systems.
Unfortunately, due to the integration of operational technology and insecure “edge device” design, the IoT trust model is built on a weak foundation of assumed trust and perimeter-based security.
At Black Hat USA and DEF CON 2018, 30 talks discussed IoT edge device exploitation.
That’s a large increase from just 19 talks on the topic in 2017.
