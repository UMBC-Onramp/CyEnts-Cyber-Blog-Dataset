It is important to note that the data is still encrypted and requires the DKM key stored in Active Directory to decrypt.
This technique, however, requires a significant change to how defenders have secured AD FS servers and monitored them for theft of the Token Signing Certificate.
First, previous techniques required code execution on an AD FS server to extract the data or at least an SMB connection to transfer the backing database files.
With a strong defense in depth program using secure credential management, EDR, and network segmentation, an enterprise can make it very difficult for a threat actor to access an AD FS server and the Token Signing Certificate.
Abusing the AD FS Replication service, however, requires only access to the AD FS server over the standard HTTP port.
The default installation of AD FS will even create a Windows Firewall rule to allow HTTP traffic from any system.
