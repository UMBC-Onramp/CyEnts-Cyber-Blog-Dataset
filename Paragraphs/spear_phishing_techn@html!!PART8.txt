PowerShell registry persistence Fourth Stage PowerShell Inject-LocalShellCode
The HKCU\\Console\\FontSecurity registry contains the fourth stage PowerShell script, shown decoded in Figure 12.
This script borrows from the publicly available Inject-LocalShellCode PowerShell script from PowerSploit to inject shellcode.
Figure 12:
Code to inject shellcode Shellcode Analysis The shellcode has a custom XOR based decryption loop that uses a single byte key (0xD4), as seen in Figure 13.
Figure 13:
Decryption loop and call to decrypted shellcode After the shellcode is decrypted and run, it injects a Poison Ivy backdoor into the userinit.exe as shown in Figure 14.

Code injection in userinit.exe and attempt to access Poison Ivy related DAT files In the decrypted shellcode, we also observed content and configuration related to Poison Ivy.
