Figure 3: Snippet of the encoded text on page source The decoding is done by a Web Open Font Format (WOFF) font file, which happens upon loading the page in a browser and will not be visible in the page content itself.
Figure 4 shows the substitution cipher method and the WOFF font file.
The attacker does this to evade detection by security vendors.
Many security vendors use static or regex signature-based rules, so this method will break those na√Øve-based conditions.
Figure 4: WOFF substitution cipher Loading this custom font which decodes the text is done inside the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
This technique is rare as JavaScript functions are traditionally used to encrypt and decrypt HTML text.
Figure 5: CSS file for loading WOFF font file Figure 5 shows the CSS file used to load the WOFF font file.
We have also seen the same CSS file, style.css, being hosted on the following domains: hxxps://www.lifepointecc[.]com/wp-content/sinin/style.css hxxps://candyman-shop[.]com/auth/DHL_HOME/style.css hxxps://mail.rsi-insure[.]com/vendor/ship/dhexpress/style.css hxxps://www.scriptarticle[.]com/thro/HOME/style.css These legitimate-looking domains are not hosting any phishing websites as of now; instead, they appear to be a repository for attackers to use in their phishing campaigns.
