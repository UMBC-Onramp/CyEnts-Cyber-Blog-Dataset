We have identified more than 3,000 apps on Google Play that contain versions 2.5.0 to 4.0.2 of InMobi – and which have over 100,000 downloads each as of December, 2013.
Currently, the total download count for these affected apps is greater than 3.7 billion .
We have informed both Google and InMobi of our findings, and they have been actively working to address them.
New InMobi Update after FireEye Notification After we notified the InMobi vendor about these security issues, they promptly released new SDK versions 4.0.3 and 4.0.4.
The 4.0.3 SDK, marked as “Internal release”, was superseded by 4.0.4 after one day.
The 4.0.4 SDK made the following changes:
Changed its method exposed through annotation for making phone calls ( makeCall ) to require user’s consent.
Added a new storePicture interface to download and save specified files from the Internet to the user’s Downloads folder.
