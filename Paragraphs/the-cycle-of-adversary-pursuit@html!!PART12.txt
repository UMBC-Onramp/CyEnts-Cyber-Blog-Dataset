Starting from a singular intrusion at a Managed Defense client, we were able to discover UNC1878 activity at multiple customers.
Using our analysis of the early stages of their activity allowed us to pivot and pursue this actor across otherwise unrelated investigations.
As we refine and expand our understanding of UNC1878â€™s tradecraft, our team enables Mandiant and Managed Defense to efficiently identify, respond to, and eradicate a financially motivated threat actor whose end goal could cripple targeted organizations.
