Figure 6.2 is a screenshot of a proxy tool showing how the packet with the stolen victimâ€™s sensitive data is sent to its C2 server.
It uses the HTTP Post method with a randomized URL to submit the stolen data in the body, which consists of a 40H-long exported key at the beginning with the encrypted data following, as shown in Figure 6.2.
The C2 server can decrypt the submitted data using the 40H exported key.
Conclusion In Part II of this analysis, I started with a received module packet from a C2 server and explained the structure of the packet.
