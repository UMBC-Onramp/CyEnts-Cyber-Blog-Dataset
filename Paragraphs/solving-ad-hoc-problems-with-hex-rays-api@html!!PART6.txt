In order to extract information from or modify the decompiled code, we have to interact with the ctree nodes via methods dependent on the node type.
However, the following question arises: “How do we reach the nodes?”
This is done via a class exposed by Hex-Rays: the tree visitor ( ctree_visitor_t ).
This class has two virtual methods, visit_insn and visit_expr , that are executed when a statement or expression is found while traversing the ctree.
