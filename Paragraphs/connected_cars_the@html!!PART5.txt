Since many modern vehicles can be better described as a computer attached to four wheels and an engine, their mobility and power present challenges to this means of countering threat activity.
We have already witnessed malware designed to hijack IoT devices for malicious purposes; vehicular systemsâ€™ greater computing power, compared to connected home thermostats, can significantly enhance their value as a C2 node .
Locating vehicles used to route malicious traffic would present a major challenge to law enforcement investigation, largely due to their mobility.
We have not yet observed threat actors using connected vehicle systems to route malicious traffic, but it is most likely that a vehicle would be used as a final hop point to the intended target network.
The perpetrators may use the vehicle only once, choosing to hijack the connectivity of a different vehicle on their next operation, and so on.
