As noted by Ars Technica , however, MITM attacks are now evolving to target supposedly secure HTTPS protected websites.
Known as cross-protocol attacks, these efforts leverage the function of transport layer security protocols.
With them, they can protect the integrity of TCP connections rather than the server itself.
This makes it possible for attackers to redirect HTTPS traffic to a substitute file transfer protocol server.
From there, that could empower cross-site scripting or cookie-stealing attacks.
Standard MITM attacks can often be prevented with robust VPN solutions.
