Command & Control Communication
The C2 communication of Zyklon is proxied through the Tor network.
The malware sends a POST request to the C2 server.
The C2 server is appended by the gate.php, which is stored in file memory.
The parameter passed to this request is getkey=y.
In response to this request, the C2 server responds with a Base64-encoded RSA public key (seen in Figure 12).
Figure 12: Zyklon public RSA key After the connection is established with the C2 server, the malware can communicate with its control server using the commands shown in Table 1.
