Regin Regin is a highly modular Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
This allowed it to be highly flexible, adapting to a targeted environment.
Regin was also successful because it was very innocuous in its operation.
Files that were exfiltrated were often kept in an encrypted container.
But instead of being stored in multiple files, everything was held in a single file, thereby avoiding arousing the suspicions of system administrators or AV software.
According to Der Spiegel, Regin was a creation of the United States NSA and designed to spy on the EU and its citizens.
