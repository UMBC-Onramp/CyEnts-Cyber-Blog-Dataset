A while ago, for example, Google Play carried a fake Madgicx advertising network app and a fake TikTok ad-management app that would insistently prompt for the user’s Facebook account data and, if user provided it, would steal the account.
Apps from alternative stores Finally, many such apps remain available from alternative stores even after Google removes them from its store.
Which is no surprise; even Google, with vastly more resources than the average company, can’t always promptly moderate the great volume of existing apps.
Yet we decided to mention this aspect here, as it provides clear evidence that alternative stores are unsafe to use.
If still intending to use them for whatsoever reason, at least install a reliable mobile antivirus to protect you against dangerous apps.
That said, as we see from this story, as well as many other episodes of malware getting into the official Google app store , even if you download your apps only from Google Play, you are still better off with an antivirus on your smartphone.
