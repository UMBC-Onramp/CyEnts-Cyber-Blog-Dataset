Finding isolated subgraphs was originally researched to help automatically identify inline functions.
It does this, but it turns out that this graph construct occurs naturally in code without inline functions.
This isnâ€™t a bad thing as it shows a natural grouping of nodes that could be a good candidate to group to help simplify the overall graph and make analysis easier.
Once the chooser is active, you can double click (or press Enter) on a row in the chooser to highlight the nodes that make up the subgraph, as seen in Figure 9.

Highlighted isolated subgraph You can create a group for an isolated subgraph by: Right-clicking on the chooser row and selecting \"Create group\", or pressing Insert while a row is selected.
