One of the key benefits of Enhanced RDP Security is that it enables the use of Network Level Authentication (NLA) when using CredSSP as the external security protocol.
Certificate management is always a complexity, but Microsoft does provide this through the use of Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) .
Certificates can be pushed using Group Policy Objects (GPO) where this is available.
Incompatible operating system environments must import certificates via the web interface exposed at https://<server>/Certsrv.
Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA)
To reduce the amount of initially required server resources, and thereby mitigate against denial of service attacks, network level authentication (NLA) can be used.
