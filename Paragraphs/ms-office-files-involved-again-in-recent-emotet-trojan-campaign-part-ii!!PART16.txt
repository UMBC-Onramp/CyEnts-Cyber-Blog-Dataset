The section outlined in red is like the packet header.
It contains the packet type (0x3EA) that tells the C2 server what kind of data is in the packet, a sha256 hash code (69 35 … 3C 4A) of the data, a module ID (0x14), as well as the Victim’s ID.
The subsequent data, marked in blue, starts with a data size (0x398) of the following data (from 10 55 52 4C … to the end), which are the compressed web browser credentials.
This thread-module uses eleven C2 servers to receive data stolen from the victim’s device.
The IP and Ports of these C2 servers are encrypted in memory and get decrypted before submitting the stolen data.
The three downloaded modules have the same C2 server list, which can be found in the “IOC” section at the end of this analysis.
