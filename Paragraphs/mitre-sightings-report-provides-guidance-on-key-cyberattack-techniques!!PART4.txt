Defenders can use this information to create a threat-informed defense against what they are most likely to see, not just the latest cyberthreat headlines.”
The Extremely Useful Takeaway The biggest takeaway from the research data is that 90% of all attacks arise from only 15 techniques across six tactics.
This intel is extremely useful as it significantly narrows down the most likely threats from the entire corpus of more than 370 possible techniques across 14 tactics.
The MITRE ATT&CK framework has been the de facto standard for mapping and responding to cyberattacks of all types.
Using it to analyze aggregated global threat data from various sources and then presenting according to the prevalence of potential attacks gives defenders a unique opportunity to change the economics of the attack cycle.
Instead of testing for all techniques and their respective defenses—which can be very costly and time-consuming—defenders can now prioritize specific techniques and build defenses around them while focusing their red team efforts on trying new strategies for implementing those techniques.
