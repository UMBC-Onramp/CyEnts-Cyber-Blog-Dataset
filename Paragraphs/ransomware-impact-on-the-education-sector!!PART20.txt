Similarly, botnets are an indirect threat to those organizations that become a part of the attacker’s infrastructure.
The attacker can exploit their bandwidth to launch DDoS attacks against other parties, move laterally to other institutions, or leverage the compute power for crypto mining or other illicit purposes.
This will eventually result in a loss of productivity and revenue for those victims.
We cannot emphasize more emphatically the following statement from a blog posted by Fortinet earlier this year, entitled, “ Threats Impacting Education Cybersecurity ”: “It’s common knowledge that the cost and effort associated with attack prevention tend to be significantly less than the cost associated with the fallout of a successful attack.
Therefore, in education cybersecurity and beyond, investing in comprehensive cybersecurity strategies not only protects sensitive data and infrastructure but can also help reduce costs down the line.”
