This is apparent simply from looking at known samples related to GM Bot – from SimpleLocker that is used for encryption and ransomware, to SlemBunk that is used as a banking Trojan and for credential theft, to the full-featured MazarBot backdoor.
With the leak of the GM Bot source code, the number of customized Android malware families based on this code will certainly increase.
Binary code-based study, one of FireEye Labs’ major research tools, can help us better characterize and track malware families and their relationships, even without direct access to the source code.
Fortunately, the similarities across these malware families make them easier to identify, ensuring that FireEye customers are well protected.
