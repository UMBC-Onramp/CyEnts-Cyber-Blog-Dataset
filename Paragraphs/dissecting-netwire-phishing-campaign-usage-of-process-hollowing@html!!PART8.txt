The following are the parameters for method R: Path to InstallUtil.exe (or other .NET framework tools)
Decoded NETWIRE trojan When we observed the list of processes spawned during the attack (Figure 8), we did not see the payload spawned as a separate process.
Figure 8:
Processes spawned during attack We observed that the InstallUtil.exe process was being created in suspended mode.
Once it started execution, we compared its memory artifacts to a benign execution of InstallUtil.exe and concluded that the malicious payload is being injected into the memory of the newly spawned InstallUtil.exe process.
We also observed that no arguments are passed to InstallUtil, which would cause an error under normal execution since InstallUtil always expects at least one argument.
