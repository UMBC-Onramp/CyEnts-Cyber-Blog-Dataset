All but one of these Python-based droppers first checks for execution in a VMware or Cuckoo Sandbox environment.
If found, the malware exits.
If not found, the IRONGATE dropper extracts a UPX-packed, publicly available utility ( NirSoft NetResView version 1.27 ) to audiodg.exe in the same directory as the dropper.
The dropper then executes the utility using the command audiodg.exe /scomma scxrt2.ini.
This command populates the file scxrt2.ini with a comma-separated list of network resources identified by the host system.
