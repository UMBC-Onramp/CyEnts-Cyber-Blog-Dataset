Data Extraction With the cleaned flash chip in hand, we can now explore options for reading the raw contents.
Commercial forensic acquisition devices exist, but a quick eBay or AliExpress search will produce a multitude of generic chip readers.
One such device, the XGecu Pro , supports a variety of adapters and chipsets and connects to a Windows machine using USB.
It also comes with software to interface with the XGecu Pro and can even auto-detect flash.
To connect the Spansion NAND to the XGecu Pro, we also purchased a clamshell BGA63 adapter.
Figure 13 shows the NAND inserted into the clamshell reader, and Figure 14 shows the clamshell adapter connected to the XGecu Pro device.
