As described above, the affiliate is getting money transferred mostly through an exchange (since this is being advised by the actors in the ransom note).
This is what we see in the example below.
Incoming ransomware payments via Coinbase.com are received.
The affiliate seems to pay some fee to a service but also sends BTC into Bitmix.biz a popular underground bitcoin mixer that is obfuscating the next transactions to make it difficult to link the transactions back to the ‘final’ wallet or cash-out in a (crypto) currency.
We also observed examples where the affiliates were paying for services, they bought on Hydra Market.
Hydra Market is a Russian underground marketplace where many services and illegal products are offered with payment in BTC.
