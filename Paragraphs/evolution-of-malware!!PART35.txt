The malware used in this attack, Jokra, targeted a device’s master boot record (MBR) and overwrote them.
Many users of internet service providers, telecoms, and ATMs were also affected as their networks were taken offline.
This attack was attributed to Lazarus (North Korea), which also targeted Sony Corporation in 2014 by leaking confidential information in response to “The Interview,” a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The Lazarus team was also associated with attacks against the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016.
They attempted to steal $951 million but only managed to get away with $81 million due to various flags in the banking transaction chain.

This JavaScript would then render a browser inoperable, frequently displaying warnings and demands in full-screen mode (payment to unlock, selling fake remediation software or technical services, etc.).
