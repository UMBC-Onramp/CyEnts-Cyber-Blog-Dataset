Emulation of CPU instructions allows for total instrumentation of binary code where control flow can be influenced for maximum code coverage.
While emulating, all functionality can be monitored and logged in order to quickly extract indicators of compromise or other useful intelligence.
Emulation provides several advantages over execution within a hypervisor sandbox.
A key advantage is noise reduction.
While emulating, the only activity that can be recorded is either written by the malware author, or statically compiled within the binary.
