In 2019, Mandiant’s Red Team discovered a series of vulnerabilities present within Digi International’s ConnectPort X2e device, which allows for remote code execution as a privileged user.
Specifically, Mandiant’s research focused on SolarCity’s (now owned by Tesla) rebranded ConnectPort X2e device, which is used in residential solar installations.
Mandiant performs this type of work both for research purposes and in a professional capacity for their global clients.
Mandiant collaborated with Digi International and SolarCity/Tesla to responsibly disclose the results of the research, resulting in the following two CVEs: Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2020-9306, CVSS3.0: 8.8) Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CVE-2020-12878, CVSS3.0: 8.4) Technical details can be found in Digi International’s 3.2.30.6 software release , and on FireEye’s Vulnerability Disclosures GitHub project ( FEYE-2020-0019 and FEYE-2020-0020 ).
