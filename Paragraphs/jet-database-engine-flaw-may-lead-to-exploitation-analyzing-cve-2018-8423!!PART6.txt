We investigate the user-provided data of 0x00002300 to understand its purpose.
To do this we must understand the Jet database file.
Analyzing the Jet Database File Many researchers have extensively analyzed the Jet database file structure.
Some of the details of previous work can be found at the following links: Jabakobob.net Brian B GitHub To summarize, a Jet database file is organized as a collection of pages, as shown in the following image: The header page contains various information related to the file: After the header come 126 bytes, RC4 encrypted, with the specific key 0x6b39dac7, which is the same for every JetDB file.
Comparing the key value with the proof-of-concept file, we can identify that group1 is a Jet Version 3 file.
Further examination leads to a Table Definition Pages section, which describes various data structures for a table.
(Click here for details.)
The table definition data has various fields, including two of note: Index Count and Real Index Count.
