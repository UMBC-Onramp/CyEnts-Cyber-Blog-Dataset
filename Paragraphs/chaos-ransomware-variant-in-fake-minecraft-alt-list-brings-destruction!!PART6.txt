The malware does not include code to identify the language setting of the compromised machine and the ransom note is available in Japanese only.
This, combined with the formal language of the ransom note, indicates this Chaos ransomware variant specifically targets Japanese Windows users.
The ransomware also deletes shadow copies from the compromised machine, which prevents the victim from being able to recover any files that had been encrypted, making it doubly destructive.
FortiGuard Labs previously released a blog about shadow copy deletion carried out by ransomware.
Luckily this Chaos ransomware variant does not have any code to steal data from the compromised machine.
