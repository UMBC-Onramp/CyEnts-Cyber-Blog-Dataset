Because we have already shown that emulation works, the attacker simply has to send replacement data to the central station while appearing as the patient monitor.
For example, consider the following original packet coming from the patient monitor:
The patient monitor sends a packet with the patientâ€™s heartbeat stored at offset 0x71 in the payload.
The patient monitor in this screen capture is at IP address 126.4.153.150.
An attacker can ARP spoof the patient monitor with a Kali virtual machine.
The ARP packets indicate that the central station, IP address 126.1.1.1, is at MAC address 00:0c:29:
