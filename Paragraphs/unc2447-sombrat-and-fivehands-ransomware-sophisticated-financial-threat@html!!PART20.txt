FIVEHANDS
Encrypted Dropper One significant change between DEATHRANSOM and FIVEHANDS is the use of a memory-only dropper, which upon execution, expects a command line switch of -key followed by the key value necessary to perform decryption of its payload.
The payload is stored and encrypted with AES-128 using an IV of “85471kayecaxaubv”.
The decrypted FIVEHANDS payload is immediately executed after decryption.
To date, Mandiant has only observed encrypted droppers with a common imphash of 8517cf209c905e801241690648f36a97.
CLI arguments FIVEHANDS can receive a CLI argument for a path, this limits the ransomware's file encryption activities to the specified directory.
DEATHRANSOM and HELLOKITTY do not accept CLI arguments.
Locale and Mutex checks DEATHRANSOM performs language ID and keyboard layout checks.
If either of these match Russian, Kazakh, Belarusian, Ukrainian or Tatar it exits.
Neither HELLOKITTY or FIVEHANDS perform language ID or keyboard checks.
HELLOKITTY performs a mutex check while the other two do not perform mutex checks.
File Exclusions DEATHRANSOM and HELLOKITTY both exclude the same directories and files: programdata, $recycle.bin, program files, windows, all users, appdata, read_me.txt, autoexec.bat, desktop.ini, autorun.inf, ntuser.dat, iconcache.db, bootsect.bak, boot.ini, ntuser.dat.log, or thumbs.db.
The exclusions for FIVEHANDS are more extensive and contain additional files and directories to ignore.
