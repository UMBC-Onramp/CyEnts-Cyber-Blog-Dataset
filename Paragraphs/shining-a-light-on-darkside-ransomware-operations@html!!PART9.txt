RaaS affiliates are required to pass an interview after which they are provided access to an administration panel (Figure 2).
Within this panel, affiliates can perform various actions such as creating a ransomware build, specifying content for the DARKSIDE blog, managing victims, and contacting support.
Mandiant has identified at least five Russian-speaking actors who may currently, or have previously, been DARKSIDE affiliates.
Relevant advertisements associated with a portion of these threat actors have been aimed at finding either initial access providers or actors capable of deploying ransomware on accesses already obtained.
Some actors claiming to use DARKSIDE have also allegedly partnered with other RaaS affiliate programs, including BABUK and SODINOKIBI (aka REvil).
For more information on these threat actors, please see Mandiant Advantage .
