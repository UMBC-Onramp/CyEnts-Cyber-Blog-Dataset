LAPSUS$ claims that they did not steal any data from the company itself, and that their targets were mainly Okta’s customers.
Judging by the dates on the screenshots, the attackers had access to the systems as early as January 2022.
What is Okta and why could the breach be so dangerous?
Okta develops and maintains identity and access management systems.
In particular, they provide a single sign-on solution.
A huge number of large companies employ Okta’s solutions.
Kaspersky Lab experts believe that the hacker’s access to Okta’s systems can explain a number of the rather high-profile data leaks from large companies, for which hackers from LAPSUS$ have already claimed responsibility.
How cybercriminals gain access to Okta’s systems?
At the moment there is no conclusive evidence that the hackers really gained access.
