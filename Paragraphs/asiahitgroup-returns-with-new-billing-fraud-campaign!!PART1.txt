By Raj Samani on Jun 27, 2018 Are you tired yet of the music track “Despacito”?
If you downloaded this ringtone app from Google Play, chances are your answer is a resounding
Yes.
But it gets worse: The McAfee Mobile Research team recently found 15 apps on Google Play that were uploaded by the AsiaHitGroup Gang.
The ringtone app was one of them—downloaded 50,000 times from the official app store—that were designed to steal money from their victims.
The AsiaHitGroup Gang has been active since at least 2016, attempting to charge 20,000 victims for the download of popular mobile applications containing the fake-installer app Sonvpay.
