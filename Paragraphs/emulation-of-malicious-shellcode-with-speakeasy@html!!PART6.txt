Shellcode as an Attack Platform In general, shellcode is an excellent choice for attackers to remain stealthy on an infected system.
Shellcode runs within executable memory and does not need to be backed by any file on disk.
This allows attacker code to hide easily within memory where most forms of traditional forensic analysis will fail to identify it.
Either the original binary file that loads the shellcode must first be identified, or the shellcode itself must be dumped from memory.
To avoid detection, shellcode can be hidden within a benign appearing loader, and then be injected into another user mode process.
