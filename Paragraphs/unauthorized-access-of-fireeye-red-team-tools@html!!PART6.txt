FireEye Products Protect Customers Against These Tools Teams across FireEye have worked to build the countermeasures to protect our customers and the broader community.
We have incorporated these countermeasures into our products and shared these countermeasures with our partners, including the Department of Homeland Security, who have incorporated the countermeasures into their products to provide broad coverage for the community.
More information on the detection signatures available can be found in the GitHub repository .
