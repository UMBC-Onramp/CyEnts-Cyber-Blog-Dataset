The APC routine checks if the argument is directory and will create the “ README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt ” ransom note regardless of whether the files in the directory were encrypted.
If the argument is a file, the ENCDEFILE routine will be called.
Unlike most other ransomwares, Diavol does not use any symmetric encryption but only RSA to encrypt the files.
ENCDEFILE checks the file size.
If it is less than 2,000,000 bytes, then only up to the first 11,700 bytes will be encrypted.
