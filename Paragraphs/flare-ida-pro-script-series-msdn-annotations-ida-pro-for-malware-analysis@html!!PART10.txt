Download the tilib archive and extract the binary into %IDADIR%.
If you run tilib without any arguments and it displays its help message, the program is running correctly.
Run MSDN_crawler/msdn_crawler.py <path to extracted MSDN documentation> <path to tilib.exe> <path to til files>
With these prerequisites fulfilled, you can run the MSDN_crawler.py script, located in the MSDN_crawler directory.
It expects the path to the TIL files you want to extract (normally %IDADIR%/til/pc/) and the path to the extracted MSDN documentation.
