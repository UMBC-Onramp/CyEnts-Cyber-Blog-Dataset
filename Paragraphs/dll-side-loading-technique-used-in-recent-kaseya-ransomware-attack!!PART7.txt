You can see them if you look in the right location in the malware code before it executes its infection routine.
Decrypting the Ransom Note To extract the ransom note, REvil ransomware decrypts a large chunk of bytes using a simple RC4 algorithm to generate a base64 blob of string.
This string is then decoded by calling the CryptStringToBinaryW API, as shown in Figure 4.
The RC4 algorithm shown above is the same code that decrypts most of the strings that the malware needs, including the C&Cs used to exfiltrate information from the infected machine (Figure 5).
