Table 1:
Exploitation timing for patched vulnerabilities ranges from within hours of patch issuance to years after initial disclosure Case Studies We continue to observe espionage and financially motivated groups quickly leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in their operations.
The following examples demonstrate the speed with which sophisticated groups are able to incorporate vulnerabilities into their toolsets following public disclosure and the fact that multiple disparate groups have repeatedly leveraged the same vulnerabilities in independent campaigns.
Successful operations by these types of groups are likely to have a high potential impact.
