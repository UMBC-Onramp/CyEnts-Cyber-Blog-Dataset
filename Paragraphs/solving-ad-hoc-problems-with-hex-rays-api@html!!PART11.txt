The important part of our code is the ctree visitor mentioned earlier, which is shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6:
Custom ctree visitor The logic implemented here is pretty straightforward.
We define our subclass of a ctree visitor (line 1) and override its visit_expr method.
This will only kick in when an assignment is found (line 9).
Another condition to be met is that the left side of the assignment is a variable and the right side a number (line 15).
