If the file size is equal or greater than 2,000,000 bytes, then just the first 1,170,000 bytes will be encrypted.
Each block of 11,700 bytes is split into ten chunks of 117 bytes each, and each chunk is encrypted using CryptEncrypt API.
117 plaintext bytes then become 128 bytes of ciphertext.
Therefore, 11,700 bytes become 12,800 bytes following the encryption.
Diavol overwrites the file and writes 11,700 encrypted bytes at the chunkâ€™s original offset and appends the 1,100 remaining bytes to the end of the file.
