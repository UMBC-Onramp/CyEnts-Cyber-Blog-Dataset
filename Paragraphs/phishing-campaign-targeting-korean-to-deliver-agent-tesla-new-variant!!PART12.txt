Agent Tesla publishes a Setup program that allows the attacker to choose which features to enable.
The Tesla Agent Setup program then compiles the Agent Tesla payload file according to those choices.
Agent Tesla starts these tasks in its Main() (stealing credentials), Timer (keylogger, stealing clipboard data, taking screenshots), and Thread (stealing cookies from browsers) functions.
