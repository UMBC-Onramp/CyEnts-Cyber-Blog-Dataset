The DLL has an export function that is invoked by the NSIS executable.
This export function has code to read and decrypt the data file, which yields the second stage payload (a portable executable file).
The DLL then spawns itself (dropper) in SUSPENDED_MODE and injects the decrypted PE using process hollowing.
Analysis of Injected Code (Second Stage Payload)
The second stage payload is a highly obfuscated executable.
It consists of a routine that decrypts a chunk of code, executes it, and re-encrypts it.
At the entry point, the executable contains code that checks the OS major version, which it extracts from the Process Environment Block (PEB).
If the OS version value is less than 6 (prior to Windows Vista), the executable terminates itself.
