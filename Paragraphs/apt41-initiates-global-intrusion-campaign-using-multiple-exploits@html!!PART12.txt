Example APT41 Cobalt Strike BEACON jquery malleable C2 profile HTTP request Within a few hours of initial exploitation, APT41 used the storescyncsvc.dll BEACON backdoor to download a secondary backdoor with a different C2 address that uses Microsoft CertUtil, a common TTP that we’ve observed APT41 use in past intrusions , which they then used to download 2.exe (MD5: 3e856162c36b532925c8226b4ed3481c).
The file 2.exe was a VMProtected Meterpreter downloader used to download Cobalt Strike BEACON shellcode.
The usage of VMProtected binaries is another very common TTP that we’ve observed this group leverage in multiple intrusions in order to delay analysis of other tools in their toolkit.
