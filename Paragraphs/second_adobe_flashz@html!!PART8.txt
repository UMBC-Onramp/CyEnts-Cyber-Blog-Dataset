The threat group appears to have used procured and compromised infrastructure to target Japanese organizations.
In two days we have observed at least two victims related to this attack.
We cannot confirm how the organizations were targeted, though similar incidents involving SWC and exploitation of the Flash vulnerability CVE-2015-5119 lured victims with phishing emails.
Additionally, the limited popularity of the niche site also contributes to our suspicion that phishing emails may have been the lure, and not incidental web browsing.
Malware Overlap with Other Chinese Threat Groups We believe that this is a concerted campaign against Japanese companies given the nature of the SWC.
The use of SOGU malware and dissemination method is consistent with the tactics of Chinese APT groups that we track.
Chinese APT groups have previously targeted the affected Japanese organizations, but we have yet to confirm which group is responsible for this campaign.
