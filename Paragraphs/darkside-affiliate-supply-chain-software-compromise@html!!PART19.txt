LSASS Dumping and Lateral Movement Mandiant observed this attacker dump the LSASS process using Task Manager to a file named lsass.
DMP, and later, zip the dump into two files named lsass.zip and lsass2.zip located in the C:\\ProgramData\\psh\\ directory.
From this point, the attacker was observed moving laterally to different systems in the environment using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections.
