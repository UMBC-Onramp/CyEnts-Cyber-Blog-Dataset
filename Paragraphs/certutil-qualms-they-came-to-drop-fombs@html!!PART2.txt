Everybody’s Working for the Recon While monitoring our customers around the clock, FireEye Managed Defense identified suspicious file write activity on a system at a European manufacturing client and began our initial investigation by collecting the available volatile and non-volatile data from the affected host.
 
Once evidence collection had completed, we began parsing the forensic data using the parsers available in FireEye's free Redline forensic analysis tool.
Analysis of the logs quickly revealed that there were commands executed on the host which were consistent with interactive reconnaissance activity.
Typically, once a host has successfully been compromised, attackers are presented with a command shell window which allows them to run commands on the host.
These commands can consist of reconnaissance activity which expose useful information about the host to the attacker.
