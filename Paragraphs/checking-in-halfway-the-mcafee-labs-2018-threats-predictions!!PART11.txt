Beyond these predictions, there is also a variety of other threats security professionals could be facing in the second half of 2018.
Just take VPNFilter , Hidden Cobra , and Gold Dragon for example – all of these attacks have proven that cybercriminals have come out into 2018 swinging.
They’re going after high-profile, high stakes industries, and are using deceptive and sly techniques in order to steal information from these targets.
Needless to say, the threat landscape is going to continue to change and evolve throughout 2018.
However, no matter how the rest of the year unfolds, we’re confident that cyber defenders are ready to take on any future threat that may come their way.
