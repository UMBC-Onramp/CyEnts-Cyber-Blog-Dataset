This report contains events of interest that are logged during emulation.
Like most emulators, all Windows API calls are logged along with arguments.
All entry points are emulated and tagged with their corresponding API listings.
In addition to API tracing, other specific events are called out including file, registry and network access.
All decoded or “memory resident” strings are dumped and displayed in the report to revealed useful information not found within static string analysis.
