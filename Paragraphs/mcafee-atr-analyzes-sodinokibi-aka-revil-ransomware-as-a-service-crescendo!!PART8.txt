In this incident we discovered a miner gate configuration file with a Gmail address.
Using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigation techniques, we identified an individual that is most likely tied to the discovered Gmail address.
Based on our analysis, this individual is likely part of some Persian-speaking credential cracking crew harvesting RDP credentials and other types of data.
The individual is sharing information related to Masscan and Kport scan results for specific countries that can be used for brute force operations.
ACTOR PROFILE Further, we observed this actor on a Telegram channel discussing operations which align to the behavior we observed during intrusions on our honey pot.
The data shared appears to be results from tools such as Masscan or Kport-scan that would be used to compromise further assets.
