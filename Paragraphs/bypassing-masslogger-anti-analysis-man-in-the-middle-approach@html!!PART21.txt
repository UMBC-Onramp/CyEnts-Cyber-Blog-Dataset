An alternative approach to executing MassLogger’s entry point is to call the RuntimeHelpers.
PrepareMethod() API to force the JIT compiler to run on all methods.
This approach is better because it avoids running the malware, and it potentially can recover methods not called in the sample’s natural code path.
However, additional work is required to force all methods to be compiled properly.
To load and recover MassLogger methods, first run the following command (Figure 14): jitm.exe Bin-123.exe [optional_timeout] Figure 14: Command to run jitm Once the timeout expires, you should see the files jitm.log and jitm.json created in the current directory.
jitm.json contains the method tokens, method body headers and MSIL bytes of all methods recovered from Bin-123.exe .
