Within the memory which is overwritten, there is an address to the destination of a later memcpy call.
This means there is a buffer overflow vulnerability that leads to an arbitrary write condition.
The first malformed packet overwrites a section of memory with attacker-defined data â€“ in this case, the address where the attacker wishes to write to.
After an additional 95 packets are read by the system, the address controlled by the attacker will be put into memcpy as the destination buffer.
