Then read on, for we have compiled a history of ransomware with the answers to these and many more questions.
Together, let’s trace the development of blockers, cryptors, wipers, and other ransomware nasties over the past few decades.
Ransomware dictionary The following terms appear frequently in the text.
Cryptography — the science of preventing outsiders from reading confidential information.
Encryption is one aspect of cryptography.
Symmetric encryption — a data encryption method in which one key is used both to encrypt and to decrypt the information.
Asymmetric encryption — a data encryption method that involves the use of two keys: one public to encrypt the information, and one private to decrypt it.
Knowing the public key does not help with decryption; that requires the private key.
RSA — a commonly used asymmetric encryption algorithm.
