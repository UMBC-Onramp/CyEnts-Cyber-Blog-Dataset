The source port does not change.
Through these basic tests we learn a great deal: The two devices are speaking over unencrypted UDP The payload contains counters and patient information The broadcast address does not require the devices to know each other’s address
beforehand When the data is sent distinct packets contain the waveform Attacking the protocol
Our reconnaissance tells us we may have the right conditions for a replay attack.
Such an attack would not satisfy our goal of modifying data in real time across the network; however, it would provide more insight about the requirements and may prove useful in reaching our goal.
After capturing the packets from the simulated heartbeat, we attempted to replay the captures using Python’s Scapy library.
We did this with the patient monitor turned off and the central monitoring station listening for information.
After several attempts, this test was unsuccessful.
This failure shows the system expects more than just a device sending data packets to a specific IP address.
