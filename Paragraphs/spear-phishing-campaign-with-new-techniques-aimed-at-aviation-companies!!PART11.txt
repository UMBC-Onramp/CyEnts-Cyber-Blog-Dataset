Next, it allocates space for the payload using VirtualAllocEx, with size set to the payload length and page protection to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40).
It then injects the payload into the allocated space using WriteProcessMemory.
The thread context is changed to point to the payload by calling SetThreadContext and the thread is finally resumed via ResumeThread to execute the payload AsyncRAT.
After successfully injecting and executing the AsyncRAT payload, the loader exits.
AsyncRAT AsyncRAT then takes command and control of the infected machine via a C2 server.
As mentioned in the introduction, the AsyncRAT is an open-source Remote Access Tool (RAT) designed to remotely monitor and control other computers through a secure encrypted connection.
