FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Report Affected platforms :      Microsoft Windows Impacted parties :         Windows Users Impact :                          Sensitive Information Collection from Victim’s Device Severity level :               Critical FortiGuard Labs recently captured a fresh phishing campaign in which a Microsoft Excel document attached to a spam email downloaded and executed several pieces of VBscript code.
This malware is used to hijack bitcoin address information and deliver a new variant of Agent Tesla onto the victim’s device.
Agent Tesla, first discovered in late 2014, is a known spyware focused on stealing sensitive information from a victim’s device, such as saved application credentials, keyboard inputs (keylogger), etc.
We have posted a number of detailed analysis blogs for Agent Tesla campaign captured by FortiGuard Labs over the past several year.
Interestingly, Agent Tesla is a commercial software that is sold online, as shown in Figure 1.1, below.
On the website shown above, attackers can purchase it anonymously using the payment methods of \"Perfect Money\" or \"Bitcoin Payment\".
I conducted research on this latest phishing campaign, and in this post I will share my findings on how the campaign is started, what the Macro within the attached Microsoft Excel does and how it is executed, as well as how it performs bitcoin address hijack and delivers a new variant of Agent Tesla onto the victim’s device.
Analysis of the Excel File from the Phishing Email As you may have noticed in Figure 2.1, the subject has been marked with “SPAM detected by FortiMail” to notify the customer that the email is a spam.
