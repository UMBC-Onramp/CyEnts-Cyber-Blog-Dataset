For this, a binary instrumentation script was written, which logged all the instructions executed along with its registers and accessed memory values.
Diffing two distinct execution traces by comparing the instruction pointer (RIP) value, I found a control flow change in windowscodecs!CCCITT::Expand2DLine due to a usage of an uninitialized value.
Back tracing the uninitialized value using TTD trace was exceptionally useful for finding the root cause.
The following section shows the allocation, population and use of the uninitialized value, which leads to the control flow change and deviance in the pixel outputs.
