Authorship We found at least two distinct versions of the BlackWorm tool, including an original/private version (v0.3.0) and the Dark Edition (v2.1).
The original BlackWorm builder was co-authored by Naser Al Mutairi from Kuwait, better known by his online moniker 'njq8'.
He is also known to have coded njw0rm , njRAT/LV , and earlier versions of H-worm/Houdini .
We found his code being used in a slew of other RATs such as Fallaga and Spygate.
BlackWorm v0.3.0 was also co-authored by another actor, Black Mafia.
About section within the original version of BlackWorm builder Within the underground development forums, itâ€™s common for threat actors to collaborate on toolsets.
Some write the base tools that other attackers can use; others modify and enhance existing tools.
The BlackWorm builder v2.1 is a prime example of actors modifying and enhancing current RATs.
After njq8 and Black Mafia created the original builder, another author, Black.
Hacker, enhanced its feature set.
