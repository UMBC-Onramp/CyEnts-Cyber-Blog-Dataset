A command injection vulnerability exists in vulnerable versions of Apache Druid.
A remote unauthenticated user can create a specially crafted request with embedded JavaScript code that is executed, even if this feature is disabled.
As a result, it can lead to command injection and remote code execution.
This happens as vulnerable versions of Druid fail to validate the abnormal JSON request body with empty keys.
This overrides the default configuration and allows malicious users to execute arbitrary code.
While fixing this issue, Druid developers have mentioned that this vulnerability was a result of an existing bug in Jackson deserializer, a Java library that helps in converting JSON strings into Java objects.
