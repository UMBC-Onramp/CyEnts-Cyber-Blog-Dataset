1994-95:
The warez scene and the first phishing attacks As internet usage gained traction in the United States through the launch of services such as America Online (AOL), CompuServe, and Prodigy, so did the growth of scams and phishing.
For many who grew up in AOL chatrooms, the progz (slang for programs) and warez (slang for software) scene of the mid-90s was revolutionary.
Because dial-up internet access was quite expensive, being provisioned by the minute, many threat actors were interested in stealing account credentials.
New programs began being traded on illicit warez chatrooms that contained punterz (to kick people offline), phishing progz (to steal user accounts), and tools used to generate random credit cards.
One of the most famous programs was AOHell, a play on the name of AOL, which contained a random account creator that used randomly created credit card accounts to open an account for free for a month.
