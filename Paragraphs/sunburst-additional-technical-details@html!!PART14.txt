In “passive” mode, the backdoor communicates with its C2 coordinator via DNS and receives high-level updates to its state.
For example, the C2 coordinator may tell the backdoor to go to sleep or spring into action.
When the backdoor is in “active” mode, it communicates via HTTP to its final C2 server and receives detailed commands such as “spawn a process” or “transfer a file”.
DNS C2 and the C2 Coordinator Protocol
When communicating with the C2 coordinator, the backdoor continuously generates domains via its DGA.
The backdoor delays execution for random intervals between generating domains.
In some cases, this delay is up to 9 hours.
If the C2 coordinator responds with a DNS A record, SUNBURST checks the resolved address against a hard-coded list of IP address blocks.
If the address falls within a block, the backdoor transitions into an associated mode.
The backdoor starts in the “passive” mode where it does nothing but check blocklists, sleep, and beacon via DNS until a transition is seen.
