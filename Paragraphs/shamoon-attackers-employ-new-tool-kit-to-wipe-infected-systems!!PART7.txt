The new wave of Shamoon is accompanied by a .Net tool kit that spreads Shamoon Version 3 and the wiper Filerase.
This first component (OCLC.exe) reads two text files stored in two local directories.
Directories “shutter” and “light” contain a list of targeted machines.
OCLC.exe starts a new hidden command window process to run the second component, spreader.exe, which spreads the Shamoon variant and Filerase with the concatenated text file as parameter.
The spreader component takes as a parameter the text file that contains the list of targeted machines and the Windows version.
It first checks the Windows version of the targeted computers.
The spreader places the executable files (Shamoon and Filerase) into the folder Net2.
It creates a folder on remote computers: C:\\\\Windows\\System32\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\Signing.
The spreader copies the executables into that directory.
It runs the executables on the remote machine by creating a batch file in the administrative share \\\\RemoteMachine\\admin$\\\\process.bat.
This file contains the path of the executables.
The spreader then sets up the privileges to run the batch file.
If anything fails, the malware creates the text file NotFound.txt, which contains the name of the machine and the OS version.
This can be used by the attackers to track any issues in the spreading process.
The following screenshot shows the “execute” function: If the executable files are not present in the folder Net2, it checks the folders “all” and Net4.
