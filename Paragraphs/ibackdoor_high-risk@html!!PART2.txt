The offending ad library contains identifying data suggesting that it is a version of the mobiSage SDK [1].
We found 17 distinct versions of the backdoored ad library, with version codes between 5.3.3 and 6.4.4.
However, in the latest mobiSage SDK publicly released by adSage [2], identified as version 7.0.5, the backdoors are not present.
We cannot determine with certainty whether the backdoored versions of the library were actually released by adSage, or whether they were created and/or compromised by a third party.
As of publication of this blog, we have identified 2846 apps published in the App Store containing backdoored versions of mobiSage SDK.
