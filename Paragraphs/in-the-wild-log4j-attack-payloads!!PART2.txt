These attacks are initiated using a tool called “JNDIExploit”, a java-based exploitation framework that specifically targets JNDI vulnerabilities.
Local JNDI vulnerabilities have existed in the past before Log4j exposed them to the outside world.
At Blackhat 2016, researchers presented their paper on JNDI attacks.
The JNDIExploit tool can start its own LDAP and HTTP server and is capable of receiving different types of payloads, including command execution and reverse shell.
JNDIExploit usage For instance, when the URL has the “ Basic/Command” string, it will execute whatever command is in the URL after that.
If the URL has the “Basic / ReverseShell ” string, it will invoke a reverse shell.
It does this by dynamically generating a Java class that will perform the command and sends the location of that Java class as a response to the LDAP query.
