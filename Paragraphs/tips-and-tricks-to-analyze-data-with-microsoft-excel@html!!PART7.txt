Of course, various sources of evidence do not always log time the same way.
Some may be local time, some may be UTC, and as mentioned, data from sources in various geographical locations complicates things further.
When compiling timelines, it is important to first know whether the evidence source is logged in UTC or local time.
If it is logged in local time, we need to confirm which local time zone the evidence source is from.
Then we can use the Excel TIME() Â formula to convert timestamps to UTC as needed.
This example scenario is based on a real investigation where the target organization was compromised via phishing email, and employee direct deposit information was changed via an internal HR application.
In this situation, we have three log sources: email receipt logs, application logins, and application web logs.
The email logs are recorded in UTC and contain the following information: The application logins are recorded in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and contain the following: The application web logs are also recorded in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and contain the following: To take this information and turn it into a master timeline, we can use the CONCAT function (an alternative to the ampersand concatenation used previously) to make a summary of the columns in one cell for each log source, such as this example formula for the email receipt logs: This is where checking our time zones for each data source is critical.
