We did not identify any Newsday interview with the activist in question on this topic.
In another instance, a persona posing as a journalist directed tweets containing audio of an interview conducted with a former U.S. Government official at real media personalities, calling on them to post about the interview.
Conclusion We are continuing to investigate this and potentially related activity that may be being conducted by actors in support of Iranian interests.
At this time, we are unable to provide further attribution for this activity, and we note the possibility that the activity could have been designed for alternative purposes or include some small percentage of authentic behavior.
