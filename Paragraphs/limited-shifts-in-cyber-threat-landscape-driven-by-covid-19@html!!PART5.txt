Threat to Healthcare Though we have no reason to believe there is a sudden, elevated threat to healthcare, the criticality of these systems has probably never been greater, and thus the risk to this sector will be elevated throughout this crisis.
The threat of disruption is especially disconcerting as it could affect the ability of these organizations to provide safe and timely care.
This threat extends beyond hospitals to pharmaceutical companies, as well as manufacturing, administration and logistics organizations providing vital support.
Additionally, many critical public health resources lie at the state and local level.
Though there is some anecdotal evidence suggesting some ransomware actors are avoiding healthcare targets, we do not expect that all actors will practice this restraint.
