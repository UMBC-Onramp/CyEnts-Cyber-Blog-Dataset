For the classification task, we separated the IRA datasets that were previously combined for LM fine-tuning, and selected posts from only one of them for the group associated with CLS = 1 .
To perform dataset selection quantitatively, we fine-tuned LMs on each IRA dataset to produce three different LMs while keeping 33% of the posts from each dataset held out as test data.
