Figure 4:
Vendors with 10 exploit modules or more Figure 4 does not necessarily indicate which vendors are the most targeted, but which products have received the most attention from exploit writers.
Several factors could contribute to this, including the availability of software to experiment with, general ease of writing an exploit on particular vulnerabilities, or how the vulnerability matches against the expertise of the exploit writers.
Some of the vendors included in the graph have been acquired by other companies, however we tracked them separately as the vulnerability was identified prior to the acquisition.
