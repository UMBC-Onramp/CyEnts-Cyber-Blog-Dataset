One of the most critical takeaways from nearly every research of this kind is that criminals overwhelmingly target known vulnerabilities with available patches.
This makes cyber hygiene a top priority.
Similarly, it reemphasizes the need to backup critical data.
If regular backups are not implemented or are not properly managed, it could cost the institutions hundreds of thousands of dollars to replace affected devices.
However, even when a victim has secured backups and an excellent recovery plan in place, attackers will still threaten to leak stolen data.
If the ransom is not paid, they release everything on the dark web.
 
Therefore, it is imperative to have a solid prevention and recovery plan against ransomware in place, including the encryption of all data at rest.
