Figure 5.2 shows an example of data with packet number “6”, which contains the basic information (“header” part) and the Stolen Data (“data” part) that is base64-encoded cookies.
“0de264895c1ed90486c73c6eb110af6c2222264a0854b0047b9ead88b718f7d0\" is the Separator string that is hardcoded in Agent Tesla.
The Victim ID is a MD5 hash value generated from the system’s hardware information.
Agent Tesla provides seven kinds of packets to send data/status to the attacker.
Each packet has a packet number to identify the packet.
They are “0”, “1”, “2”, “3”, “4”, “5” and “6”.
Packet “0”:
It is always the first packet to tell the attacker that Agent Tesla has started.
It only contains the “header” data.
Packet “1”: It is sent once every 120 seconds.
It is like a heartbeat to tell the attacker that Agent Tesla is alive.
It only contains the “header” data.
Packet “2”: It is sent every 60 seconds and only contains the “header” data.
