Sentry nodes will not be included in the new group, and they halt the graph traversal when searching for reachable nodes.
For example, in Figure 5, selecting the green node first treats it as the starting node, and selecting the red node second treats it as a sentry node.
Running the “Create unique-reachable group” plug-in option creates a new group made of the green node and all blue nodes.
This can be useful when you are done analyzing a subset of the current graph, and wish to hide the details behind a group node so you can concentrate on the rest of the graph.
