Botnet The Fortinet fabric can offer end to end protection to educational institutions using the following technologies - FortiMail (blocking phishing attacks and malicious attachments), Web Filtering (blocking malicious URLs), FortiEDR (real-time and cloud-based protection), FortiSandbox (identifying and preventing unknown attacks), FortiToken (multi-factor authentication), and intent-based segmentation (preventing lateral movement).
Organizations are also strongly encouraged to conduct ongoing end-user training designed to educate and inform personnel about the latest phishing/spearphishing techniques and how to spot and respond to them.
This should include encouraging employees to never open attachments from someone they don't know and always treat emails from unrecognized/untrusted senders with caution.
