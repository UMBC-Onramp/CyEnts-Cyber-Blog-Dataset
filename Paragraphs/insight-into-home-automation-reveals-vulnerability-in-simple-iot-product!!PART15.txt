So we used gdbserver, in conjunction with Interactive Disassembler Pro, for all debugging.
With the debugger connected, we sent the packet causing the crash and saw the exact location of the crash.
A segmentation fault occurred at address 0x2AC15B98.
From the memory layout from the Linux “proc” directory, we determined his memory address resides in library libUPnPHndlr.so. 2abf3000-2ac4d000 r-xp 00000000 1f:02 82 /rom
/lib/libUPnPHndlr.so
Because the crash was caused by a UPnP packet, it was logical to find the crash inside this library .
