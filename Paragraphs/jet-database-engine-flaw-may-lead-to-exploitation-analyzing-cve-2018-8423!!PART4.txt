This is the Jet database file.
By running poc.js through wscript.exe, we can trigger the crash.
As we see in the preceding image, we can review debug information to determine the function that crashes is “msrd3x40!TblPage::CreateIndexes.”
Furthermore, we can determine that the program is trying to write data and failing.
Specifically, we can see that the program is using the “esi” register to write to the location [edx+ecx*4+574h], but that location is not accessible.
We need to understand how this location is constructed to provide clues to the root cause.
The debug information shows that register ecx contains the value 0x00002300.
Edx is a pointer to memory that we will see again later.
Finally, they are added together with an offset of 574 hexadecimal bytes to reference the memory location.
