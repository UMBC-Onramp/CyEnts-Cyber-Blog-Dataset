This dependency on additional Objective C code to expose C functions casts limitations on the ability of a malicious actor to perform operations such as taking stealth screenshots, sending and intercepting text messages without consent, stealing photos from the gallery, or stealthily recording audio.
But these limitations can be easily lifted should an app developer choose to add a bit more Objective C code to wrap and expose these C functions.
