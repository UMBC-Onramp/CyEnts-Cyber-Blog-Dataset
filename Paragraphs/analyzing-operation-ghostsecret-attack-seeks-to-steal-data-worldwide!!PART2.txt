Our investigation into this campaign reveals that the actor used multiple malware implants, including an unknown implant with capabilities similar to Bankshot.
From March 18 to 26 we observed the malware operating in multiple areas of the world.
This new variant resembles parts of the Destover malware, which was used in the 2014 Sony Pictures attack.
Furthermore, the Advanced Threat Research team has discovered Proxysvc, which appears to be an undocumented implant.
We have also uncovered additional control servers that are still active and associated with these new implants.
Based on our analysis of public and private information from submissions, along with product telemetry, it appears Proxysvc was used alongside the 2017 Destover variant and has operated undetected since mid-2017.
The attackers behind Operation GhostSecret used a similar infrastructure to earlier threats, including SSL certificates used by FakeTLS in implants found in the Destover backdoor variant known as Escad, which was used in the Sony Pictures attack.
