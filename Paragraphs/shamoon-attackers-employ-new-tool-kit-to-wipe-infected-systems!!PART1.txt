By Thomas Roccia , Jessica Saavedra-Morales and Christiaan Beek on Dec 19, 2018 Last week the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team posted an analysis of a new wave of Shamoon “wiper” malware attacks that struck several companies in the Middle East and Europe.
In that analysis we discussed one difference to previous Shamoon campaigns.
The latest version has a modular approach that allows the wiper to be used as a standalone threat.
After further analysis of the three versions of Shamoon and based on the evidence we describe here, we conclude that the Iranian hacker group APT33—or a group masquerading as APT33—is likely responsible for these attacks.
