Specifically, the following facts support this assessment: The attacker targeted the SIS suggesting an interest in causing a high-impact attack with physical consequences.
This is an attack objective not typically seen from cyber-crime groups.
The attacker deployed TRITON shortly after gaining access to the SIS system, indicating that they had pre-built and tested the tool which would require access to hardware and software that is not widely available.
