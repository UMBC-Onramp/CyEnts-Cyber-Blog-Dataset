In 2020, Mandiant attributed nine separate intrusions to UNC2198.
UNC2198’s objective is to monetize their intrusions by compromising victim networks with ransomware.
In July 2020, Mandiant observed UNC2198 leverage network access provided by an ICEDID infection to encrypt an environment with MAZE ransomware.
As the year progressed into October and November, we observed UNC2198 shift from deploying MAZE to using EGREGOR ransomware during another Incident Response engagement.
Like MAZE, EGREGOR is operated using an affiliate model , where affiliates who deploy EGREGOR are provided with proceeds following successful encryption and extortion for payment.
The UNC2198 cluster expanded over the course of more than six months.
Mandiant’s December 2020 blog post on UNCs described the analytical tradecraft we use to merge and graduate clusters of activity.
Merging UNCs is a substantial analytical practice in which indicators and tradecraft attributed to one group are scrutinized against another.
Two former UNCs that shared similar modus operandi were eventually merged into UNC2198.
The Snowball Effect of Attribution AP created UNC2198 based on a single intrusion in June 2020 involving ICEDID, BEACON, SYSTEMBC and WINDARC.
