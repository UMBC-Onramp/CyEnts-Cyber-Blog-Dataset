Normalization As with any dataset, we had to undertake some steps to normalize the paths.
For example, the occurrence of individual usernames, while perhaps interesting from an intelligence perspective, would be represented as distinct entities when in fact they have the same semantic meaning.
Thus, we had to detect and replace usernames with <username> to normalize this representation.
Other folder idiosyncrasies such as version numbers or randomly generated directories could similarly be normalized into <version> or <random>.
A typical normalized path might therefore go from this: C:\\Users\\jsmith\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\mkzyu91952\\mkzyu91952\\obj\\x86\\Debug\\mkzyu91952.pdb To this: c:\\users\\<username>\\documents\\visual studio 2013\\projects\\<random>\\<random>\\obj\\x86\\debug\\mkzyu91952.pdb You may notice that the PDB filename itself was not normalized.
