Conclusion This research from McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team shows it is possible to emulate and modify a patient’s vital signs in real time on a medical network using a patient monitor and central monitoring station.
For this attack to be viable, an attacker would need to be on the same network as the devices and have knowledge of the networking protocol.
Any modifications made to patient data would need to be believable to medical professionals for there to be any impact.
