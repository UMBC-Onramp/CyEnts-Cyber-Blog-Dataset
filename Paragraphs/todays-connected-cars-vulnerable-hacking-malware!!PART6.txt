Entering by the (CAN) Back Door Autos use several components to interact with their parts.
Since the end of the 20th century, cars have used the dedicated controller area network (CAN) standard to allow microcontrollers and devices to talk to each other.
The CAN bus communicates with a vehicle’s electronic control unit (ECU), which operates many subsystems such as antilock brakes, airbags, transmission, audio system, doors, and many other parts—including the engine.
Modern cars also have an On-Board Diagnostic Version 2 (OBD-II) port.
Mechanics use this port to diagnose problems.
CAN traffic can be intercepted from the OBD port.
The on-board diagnostic port.
An external OBD device could be plugged into a car as a backdoor for external commands, controlling services such as the Wi-Fi connection, performance statistics, and unlocking doors.
