If the flag is 0 and the second dword is not 0 (it should be the size of the attached module to this packet), it executes the module on the victim’s device.
If the flag is 1, it goes to the flag 0’s branch.
I’ll explain this part in more detail in the next part of this analysis.
Relocate and Persistent Once Emotet receives a valid response from the C2 server, it relocates the downloaded Emotet dll file from “C:\\Windows\\ProgramData\\puihoud.dll” (in my analysis environment) into the “%LocalAppData%” folder.
  
Moreover, to remain in the victim’s device, Emotet makes itself persistent by adding the relocated file into the auto-run group in the system registry.
Emotet is then able to run at system startup.
Figure 6.1 is a screenshot of the Registry Editor displaying the auto-run item in the system registry.
