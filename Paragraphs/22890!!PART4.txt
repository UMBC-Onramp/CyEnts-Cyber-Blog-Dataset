But modifying the firmware was not enough; they still needed a way to upload it to the remote, and preferably without physical contact.
To do that, Lehman and Ziv examined how the set-top box communicates with the remote and updates its software.
They discovered that the remote had to initiate the update process.
Every 24 hours, the remote queries the set-top box and receives either a negative response or an offer to install a new version of the software, which it downloads from the set-top-box.
The researchers also found several vital flaws in the communication mechanism between the remote and the Xfinity box.
First, the former does not check the firmware’s authenticity, so it will download and install whatever firmware the set-top box (or the hacker’s computer impersonating one) offers it.
Second, although the set-top box and the remote exchange encrypted messages, the encryption is not properly enforced.
