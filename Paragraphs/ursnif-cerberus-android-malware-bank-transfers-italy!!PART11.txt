One of the actions Ursnif wishes to take here is to automate transactions that start on the desktop’s browser.
To do that, it is designed to swap the international bank account number (IBAN) and bank identifier code (BIC) numbers from legitimate transactions for an IBAN of an account the fraudster controls.
To launch its fraudulent transaction flow, Ursnif needs to start a function that would be clicked by the infected victim.
It, therefore, attempts to replace a login button from the original bank’s webpage and plant its own button that the victim will click.
The function launched is named ‘hookPay()’: Figure 8: hookPay() function – Ursnif replaces IBAN number in legitimate transactions The function being used to swap the IBAN and plan the transaction parameters is called ‘makeTrf()’.
The amount being transferred is set to move forward if the account’s balance is higher than €3,000.
