FortiGuard Labs recently encountered such a scenario, where a fuel company in Kyiv, Ukraine received a spearphishing e-mail that contained an attached invoice—seemingly from another fuel provider—that was spoofed.
The attachment is a zip file that contains the IcedID Trojan.
IcedID has been observed as far back as 2017.
Its primary function is to steal banking credentials and personal information.
It is also capable of deploying additional malware from the same group or partner organizations.
