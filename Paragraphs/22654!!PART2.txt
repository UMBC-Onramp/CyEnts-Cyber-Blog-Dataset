Our global survey of April 2020 found that nearly half of the 6,000 respondents had never worked from home before.
Despite that, in 73% of cases, employers didn’t conduct any special training on safe interaction with corporate resources over the Internet, which could have reduced the number of incidents caused by the human factor.
Corporate IT’s decreased control over devices, software, and user actions led to increased risk.
Home equipment Many companies didn’t provide their employees with corporate equipment.
Instead, they allowed staff to work and connect to the office IT infrastructure from home devices, which in many cases are poorly protected.
According to our survey, 68% of respondents worked at home using their personal computers.
In the fall, we conducted another study and found even more people in this position.
About 80% of people surveyed used their home computers for work, even though more than half (51%) of respondents were provided with the necessary equipment by their employers.
