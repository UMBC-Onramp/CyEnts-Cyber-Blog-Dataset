Writing the Exploit Before attempting exploitation, we wanted to first investigate if the system had any exploit mitigations or limitations we needed to be aware of.
We began by running an open source script called “checksec.sh”.
This script, when run on a binary, will report if any of the common exploit mitigations are in place.
Figure 21 shows the script’s output when ran on the primary Delta binary, named “dactetra”.
