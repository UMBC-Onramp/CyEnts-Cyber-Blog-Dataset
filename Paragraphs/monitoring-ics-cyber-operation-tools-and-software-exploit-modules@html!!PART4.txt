Following this premise, equipment that is vulnerable to exploits using known cyber operation tools becomes low-hanging fruit for all sorts of attackers.
ICS Cyber Operation Tool Classification Mandiant Intelligence tracks a large number of publicly available ICS-specific cyber operation tools.
The term \"ICS-specific,\" as we employ it, does not have a hard-edged definition.
While the vast majority of cyber operation tools we track are clear-cut cases, we have, in some instances, considered the intent of the tool's creator(s) and the tool's reasonably foreseeable impact on ICS software and equipment.
Note, we excluded tools that are IT-based but may affect OT systems, such as commodity malware or known network utilities.
Â We included only a few exceptions, where we identified specialized adaptations or features that enabled the tool to interact with ICS, such as the case of nmap scripts.
We assigned each tool to at least one of eight different categories or classes, based on functionality.
