By leveraging the vast amounts of connections offered by the RDP shops, we were able to quickly identify a victim that fits the profile of a high-value target in the United States.
We found a newly posted (on April 16)
Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard machine on the UAS Shop.
According to the shop details, it belonged to a city in the United States and for a mere $10 we could get administrator rights to this system.
RDP access offered for sale.
UAS Shop hides the last two octets the of the IP addresses of the systems it offers for sale and charges a small fee for the complete address.
(We did not pay for any services offered by UAS or any other shop.)
To locate the system being sold, we used shodan.io to search for any open RDP ports at that specific organization using this query: org:”City  XXX” port:”3389” The results were far more alarming than we anticipated.
The Shodan search narrowed 65,536 possible IPs to just three that matched our query.
By obtaining a complete IP address we could now look up the WHOIS information, which revealed that all the addresses belonged to a major International airport.
