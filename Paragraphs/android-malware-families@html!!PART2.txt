Interestingly, our research led us to identify an earlier malware family named SimpleLocker – the first known file-encryption ransomware on Android [ 6 ] – that also shares a common origin with these banking trojan families.
GM Bot and SlemBunk Our analysis showed that the four GM Bot samples referenced by IBM researchers all share the same major components as SlemBunk.
Figure 1 of our earlier report [ 4 ] is reproduced here, which shows the major components of SlemBunk and its corresponding class names: ServiceStarter : An Android receiver that will be invoked once an app is launched or the device boots up.
Its functionality is to start the monitoring service, MainService , in the background.
MainService : An Android service that runs in the background and monitors all running processes on the device.
It prompts the user with an overlay view that resembles the legitimate app when that app is launched.
This monitoring service also communicates with a remote host by sending the initial device data and notifying of device status and app preferences.
MessageReceiver :
An Android receiver that handles incoming text messages.
In addition to the functionality of intercepting the authentication code from the bank, this component also acts as the bot client for remote command and control (C2).
