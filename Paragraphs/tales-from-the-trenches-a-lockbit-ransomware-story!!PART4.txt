With this account, belonging to the administrator group, the attacker immediately obtained the proverbial “keys to the kingdom” with all the necessary permissions to perform a successful attack.
Unfortunately, this is not a unique case; external facing systems should always have multi-factor authentication enabled when possible.
Besides, a security organization should have a least privilege strategy when it comes to accessing systems.
Targeted ransomware attackers are successfully leveraging the “human factor” integrally.
It is no longer the typical “end-user clicking on a malicious link” causing the complete lock-up of a company.
The human factor in targeted ransomware attacks goes much deeper.
Attackers successfully leverage weaknesses in security policy and misconfigurations across an entire organization; from end-user to Domain Administrator.
Infiltrating the Network To infiltrate the network, the attacker had to take several steps to make sure the ransomware attack was successful.
An attacker always wants to infect as many systems as possible to effectively halt the business process and urge the victim to pay the ransom.
Credentials & Privileges As mentioned previously, the attacker was successful in guessing the password of the Administrator account using a brute force attack.
With this, the attacker immediately had all the necessary privileges for deploying the ransomware successfully.
