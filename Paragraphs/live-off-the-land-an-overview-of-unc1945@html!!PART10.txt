The VM contained numerous tools such as network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance tools.
Tiny Core Linux pre-loaded tools included Mimikatz, Powersploit, Responder, Procdump, CrackMapExec, PoshC2, Medusa, JBoss Vulnerability Scanner and more.
Efforts to decrease operational visibility included placing tool and output files within temporary file system mount points that were stored in volatile memory.
Additionally, UNC1945 used built-in utilities and public tools to modify timestamps and selectively manipulate Unix log files.
UNC1945 employed anti-forensics techniques with the use of a custom ELF utility named LOGBLEACH.
The actor used built-in Linux commands to alter the timestamps of files and directories and used LOGBLEACH to clean logs to thwart forensic analysis, as seen in Figure 4.
