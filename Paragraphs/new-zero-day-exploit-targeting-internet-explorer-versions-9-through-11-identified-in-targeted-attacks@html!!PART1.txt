Summary FireEye Research Labs, the intelligence behind our Mandiant Consultancy services, identified a new Internet Explorer (IE) zero-day exploit used in targeted attacks.
 The vulnerability affects IE6 through IE11, but the attack is targeting IE9 through IE11.
 
This zero-day bypasses both ASLR and DEP.
 Microsoft has assigned CVE-2014-1776 to the vulnerability and released security advisory to track this issue.
Threat actors are actively using this exploit in an ongoing campaign which we have named \"Operation Clandestine Fox.\"
However, for many reasons, we will not provide campaign details.
But we believe this is a significant zero day as the vulnerable versions represent about a quarter of the total browser market.
We recommend applying a patch once available.
According to NetMarket Share , the market share for the targeted versions of IE in 2013 were: IE 9      13.9% IE 10    11.04% IE 11     1.32% Collectively, in 2013, the vulnerable versions of IE accounted for 26.25% of the browser market.
