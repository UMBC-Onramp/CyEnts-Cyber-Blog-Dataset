Now, letâ€™s return to the JavaScript code we saw in Figure 2.
The function base64ToStream()converts the Base64-encoded serialized object to a stream.
Before we can fully understand the logic behind the JavaScript code, we need to examine the functionality of the Base64-encoded serialized object.
Thus our next step is to reverse engineer the embedded serialized object and recreate the class definition.
Once that was done, the class definition looks like the following code, which is responsible for executing the malicious shellcode.
