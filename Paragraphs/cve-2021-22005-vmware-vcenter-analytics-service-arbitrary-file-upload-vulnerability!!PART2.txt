Vulnerability Details In our lab, we have locally setup vCenter 7.0 build 17920168 to test the attack scenario.
The Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) enables VMware to collect user usage statistics to improve their product and provide better user support.
Some of these statistics are: Configuration Data Feature Usage Data Performance Data Product Log Data Use rs can opt in or out of CEIP from vCenter’s vSphere Client: VMware CEIP First, we determined how this telemetry data is collected and stored by VMware server.
By taking a look at its various configurations, Juniper Threat Labs found analytics proxy.conf that defines several API calls specific to telemetry, as shown below: /analytics/telemetry/ph/api/hyper/send /analytics/telemetry/ph/api/level VMware analytics API configuration We also observe d that l ocal and 15080 is configured which should indicate hostname and port used for these APIs.
We can see that a service called vmware -analytics is running over tcp port 15080 : vmware-analytics running over port 15080 The API in use is confirmed when we perform network capture on port 15080.
