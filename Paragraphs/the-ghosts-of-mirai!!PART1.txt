Critical It has been almost five years since the source code of the notorious MIRAI IoT malware was released to the public by its author in late 2016.
This event led to the emergence of numerous copycats, creating their own flavors of IoT botnet armies.
Although improvements have been constantly added since then by various threat actors, the structure and goal of the campaigns have remained the same.
IoT malware scans the Internet for IoT devices that use default or weak usernames and passwords.
They also seek to exploit known—and sometimes even zero-day —vulnerabilities to increase their chances of gaining access.
And once they do, malicious binaries are downloaded and executed that make the device part of a zombie network that could then be instructed to participate in a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) attack that could cause a service outage to an unfortunate target.
