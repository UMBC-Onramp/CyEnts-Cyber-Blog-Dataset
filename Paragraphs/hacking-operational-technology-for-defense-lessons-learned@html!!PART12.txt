While not impossible, bypassing this setup would require more time and resources.
We instead decided to search for other plausible attack propagation paths.
Figure 3:
Formal communication path from enterprise to OT network Reviewing the firewall configuration files, we identified a dedicated communication path for management access to a Microsoft Windows patch management server in a DMZ between the IT network and the OT network.
This patch management server was running on a virtual machine in the DMZ network, while the administration console for the underlying hypervisor software itself was hosted in the IT network.
Mandiant logged into the administration console for the hypervisor software using IT network domain administrator credentials.
We then leveraged guest machine administration features via direct console access to execute commands on the patch management server in the DMZ network.
The compromise of the patch management server in the DMZ allowed us to pivot via SMB connections to Microsoft Windows-based intermediary systems in the OT network.

Lastly, we compromised Microsoft Windows server systems in the OT network to complete the objectives of the exercise.
