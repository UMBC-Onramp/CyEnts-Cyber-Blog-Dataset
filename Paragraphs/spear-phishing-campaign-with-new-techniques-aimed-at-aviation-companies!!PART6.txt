This payload is encoded using Server.
URLEncode() and obfuscated to evade detection.
Antonin Foller's VBS decode function from PSTRUH Software ( http://www.motobit.com ) is used to decrypt the payload.
After decryption, \"Good.xml\" is written to the victim's Temp directory, where it is launched using MSBuild.exe.
If you’re not aware of this executable, it is present on all Windows machines with the .NET framework installed.
It’s a trusted developer utility used to speed up the process of creating .NET applications.
Because it is a trusted utility, adversaries use the tool in an effort to evade detection.
(See Mitre ATT&CK technique – Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution: MSBuild .)
In the script below, the payload bytes are first substituted for de-obfuscation, then decoded before being written to the Temp directory.
