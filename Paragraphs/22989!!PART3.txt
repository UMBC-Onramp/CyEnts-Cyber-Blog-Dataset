WeakAuras is essentially a framework: all timers and indicators are added to the base add-Аon using scripts written in Lua programming language, commonly called “auras”.
Many sites offer ready-made assemblies of auras for specific classes, specializations, and even professions.
Sometimes, though, players are looking for something specific, such as an aura for a single quest or an experimental tactic.
Some players versed in programming customize existing scripts or create auras themselves.
And sometimes, in a raid with random partners, an unfamiliar raid leader may demand, “we are using a new tactic to fight this boss — everyone needs to install this aura right now”, and send a link.
Of course, the decision is yours, but anyone who doesn’t install the aura can expect to be kicked out of the raid.
Worse, leaders usually drop those links into raid chats, and most players simply click on the name and install scripts without a second thought.
It is important to remember that using these scripts, which are also linked on message boards or in in-game chats, can be risky.
