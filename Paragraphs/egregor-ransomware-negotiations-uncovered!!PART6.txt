Whatâ€™s in a Ransom?
After reviewing elaborate chat logs between Egregor actors and representatives from victimized organizations, we obtained interesting insights about how the ransom amount was fixed and the overall negotiation process.
In a common flow of events, upon initial contact with victims, X-Force and Cylera analysts observed Egregor ransomware actors making an initial demand for a ransom payment that depended on the victim and their perceived ability to pay.
Analysis of approximately 50 ransom negotiations in Egregor chat logs from December 2020 shows that ransom demands varied wildly.
Average initial ransom demand $5,024,000 Average ransom payment $387,700 Highest initial ransom demand $35,000,000 Lowest initial ransom demand $100,000 Sum of all ransom demands $226,080,000 Figure 1:
