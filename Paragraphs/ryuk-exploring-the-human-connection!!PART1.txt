In collaboration with Bill Siegel and Alex Holdtman from Coveware.
At the beginning of 2019, McAfee ATR published an article describing how the hasty attribution of Ryuk ransomware to North Korea was missing the point.
Since then, collective industry peers discovered additional technical details on Ryukâ€™s inner workings , the overlap between Ryuk and Hermes2.1, and a detailed description of how the ransomware is piggybacking the infamous and ever evolving Trickbot as a primary attack vector.
In this blog post we have teamed up with Coveware to take a closer look at the adversary and victim dynamics of Ryuk Ransomware.
