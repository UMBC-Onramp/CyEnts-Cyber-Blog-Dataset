Knock, Knock: FakeUpdates are Back!
In April 2018, FireEye identified a campaign that used compromised websites to deliver heavily obfuscated Trojan droppers masquerading as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, and/or Firefox browser updates.
The compromised sites contained code injected directly into the HTML or in JavaScript components rendered by the pages which had been injected.
These sites were accessed by victim users either via HTTP redirects or watering-hole techniques utilized by the attackers.
Since our April 2018 blog post , this campaign has been refined to include new techniques and the use of post-exploitation toolkits.
Recent investigations have shown threat actor activity that included internal reconnaissance, credential harvesting, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and ransomware deployment in enterprise networks.
