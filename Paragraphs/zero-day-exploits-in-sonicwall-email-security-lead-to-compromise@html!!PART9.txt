A lack of file validation can enable an adversary to upload arbitrary files, including executable code, such as web shells.
Once uploaded, these branding package ZIP archives are normally expanded and saved to the <SonicWall ES install path>\\data\\branding directory.
However, an adversary could place malicious files in arbitrary locations, such as a web accessible Apache Tomcat directory, by crafting a ZIP archive containing a file within a sequence of directory traversal notations such as in Figure 5.
Figure 5:
Example ZIP archive containing a Zip Slip web shell
It is important to note that the lack of validation which enables Zip Slip attacks is not unique to SonicWall Email Security.
As detailed in Snyk's research on the topic , they exist within the many code libraries from which applications have been built.
