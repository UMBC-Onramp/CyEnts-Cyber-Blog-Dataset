It parse s the f ile name from the file object header and concatenat es the extracted path to the base path without checking the f ile name for directory traversal characters such as “..”.
As a result, attackers can upload malicious files to their intended locations.
Although the “/ ui / vropspluginui /rest/services/ uploadova ” endpoint is supposed to be accessed only by an authenticated user, we could see that it is accessible without authentication as well.
Therefore , it is combination of authentication bypass and directory traversal.
We demonstrate this with below steps: Create a dummy test file-based archive: test file archive Upload the file to vulnerable server without authentication : file upload to the server Verify the uploaded test file: verifying the uploaded test file Remote Code Execution : To exploit the server, we try to do the following: Validate whether the server is vulnerable or not.
