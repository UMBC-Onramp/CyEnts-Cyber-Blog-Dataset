During one negotiation, Egregor offered to provide the decryption key, in exchange for the organization publicly announcing that the group does not intentionally target hospitals or charities.
In a chat with another victim, the threat actors discuss the hardships of COVID-19, even wishing the victim happy holidays.
What is ‘Egregor’?
The Egregor ransomware was first reported publicly in mid-2020, making it a relatively new entry into the criminal economy.
Egregor operators work through an affiliate model, meaning a small group of actors run and maintain the Egregor code base and other actors purchase access to Egregor and use the malware on systems they infect.
This model is best known as Ransomware as A Service (RaaS).
Many security analysts speculated that Egregor was the follow-up to the Maze ransomware, pointing to significant technical overlap between the two ransomware families after Maze’s threat actors declared retirement in November 2020.
Egregor gained significant recognition in 2021 as affiliates shifted from Maze to using this new ransomware family and leaked stolen information from impacted organizations, extorting them in efforts to collect a ransom.
The impact of Egregor ransomware has been felt worldwide with an estimated $80 million dollars in profit through their operations against at least 150 organizations.
