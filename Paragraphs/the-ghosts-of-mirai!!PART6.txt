The Enigmatic “Hajime” Hajime was dubbed as the successor to the first generation of Mirai.
Built on the same principle and goals as of its predecessor, it tries to propagate to IOT devices by means of brute-forcing credentials using a password list of common default device passwords.
However, unlike Mirai, Hajime utilizes a decentralized peer-to-peer network to issue commands to its bots.
This makes it much harder to locate the Command-and-Control (C2) server for a takedown.
Aside from its sophisticated bot network communication, it is also one of the most mysterious variants due to its vague intentions.
Commands sent to Hajime bots are in the form of structured messages that are passed along in the peer-to-peer network.
One of these commands instruct bots to download and execute binaries, internally called \"modules\".
