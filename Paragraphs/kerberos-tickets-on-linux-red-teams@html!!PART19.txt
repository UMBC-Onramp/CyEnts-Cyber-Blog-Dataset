The new Authenticator is encrypted with the service specific session key that was previously obtained from the Domain Controller.
 The authentication process is shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9:
Authenticating to SMB (AP-REQ)
Once the file share server receives the authentication request, it first extracts and decrypts the service ticket from the Kerberos authentication blob and verifies the data within.
It also extracts the service specific session key from the service ticket and attempts to decrypt the Authenticator with it.
If this operation succeeds, the user is considered to be authenticated to the service.
The server will acknowledge the successful authentication by sending one final Authenticator back to the user, encrypted with the service specific session key.
This action completes the mutual authentication process.
The response (contained within an “ap-rep” structure) is shown in Figure 10.
