The emulator class is chosen automatically when a binary is loaded based on its PE headers or is specified as shellcode.
Subclassing Speakeasy makes it easy to access, extend, or modify interfaces.
It also facilitates reading and writing stateful data before, during, and after emulation.
Emulating a Binary Figure 2 shows how to load a binary into the Speakeasy emulator.
self.module = self.load_module(filename) Figure 2: Loading the binary into the emulator The load_module function returns a PeFile object for the provided binary on disk.
It is an instance of the PeFile class defined in speakeasy/windows/common.py , which is subclassed from pefile â€™s PE class.
Alternatively, you can provide the bytes of a binary using the data parameter rather than specifying a file name.
