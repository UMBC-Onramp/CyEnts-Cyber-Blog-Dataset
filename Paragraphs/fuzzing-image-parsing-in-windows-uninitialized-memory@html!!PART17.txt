Unlike the previous vulnerability, the difference in the output is quite limited in this one, as seen in Figure 5.
One of the simpler root cause analysis techniques that can be used to figure out a specific type of uninitialized memory usage is comparing execution traces of runs that produce two different outputs.
This specific technique can be helpful when an uninitialized variable causes a control flow change in the program and that causes a difference in the outputs.
