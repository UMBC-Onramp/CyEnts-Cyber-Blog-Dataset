The targets will be reached, regardless of conditions during emulation that may have caused different branches to be taken.
Figure 2 illustrates a set of code branches that iterate has forced to be taken in order to reach its target; the flags set by the cmp instructions are irrelevant.
  Like the emulateRange API, options for user-defined hooks for both individual instructions and for when “call” instructions are encountered are provided.
An example use of the iterate API is for the function argument tracking technique mentioned earlier in this post.
Figure 2:
A path of emulation determined by the iterate API in order to reach the target address emulateBytes – This API provides a way to simply emulate a blob of extraneous shellcode.
