The malware creates a pipe that the DLL reads later and prepares strings as the mutex string for the DLL.
Preparing the string for the DLL.
The DLL has dummy strings for these strings.
Creating the new mutex and relaunching the process.
This mutex is checked when the malware starts.
The function returns a 1 or 0, depending on whether it can open the mutex.
Later, this result is checked and if the mutex can be opened the malware will avoid checking the version and will not use the two new exploits to elevate privileges.
