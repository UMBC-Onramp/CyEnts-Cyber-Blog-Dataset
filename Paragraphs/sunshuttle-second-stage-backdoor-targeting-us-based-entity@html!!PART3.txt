Notably, SUNSHUTTLE uses cookie headers to pass values to the C2, and if configured, can select referrers from a list of popular website URLs to help such network traffic “blend in.”
The SUNSHUTTLE backdoor file examined, “Lexicon.exe” (MD5: 9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd), was written in GoLang.
The file unpacks into MD5: 86e89349fefcbdd9d2c80ca30fa85511.
The infection vector for SUNSHUTTLE is not known.
It is most likely a second-stage backdoor dropped after an initial compromise.
The SUNSHUTTLE sample uses the actor-controlled server “reyweb[.]com” for C2.
“Reyweb[.]com” is registered anonymously via NameSilo, a domain provider who accepts bitcoin payment and has been used for C2 registration by state-sponsored APTs in the past, including Russia-nexus actors and Iran-nexus APTs
Mandiant observed SUNSHUTTLE at a victim compromised by UNC2452, and have indications that it is linked to UNC2452, but we have not fully verified this connection.
Please see FireEye’s resource center for background on UNC2452 and the SUNBURST campaign .
Outlook and Implications The new SUNSHUTTLE backdoor is a sophisticated second-stage backdoor that demonstrates straightforward but elegant detection evasion techniques via its “blend-in” traffic capabilities for C2 communications.
