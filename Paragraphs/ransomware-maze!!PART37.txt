It does not run on Windows operating systems older than Vista as this makes analysis harder.
By using the malware as a DLL, they can inject this module into a target process more easily than if they use an EXE sample of the malware.
Instead of deleting the “Shadow Volumes” the developers instead use WMIC with the special trick of the path as mentioned earlier, using WMIC classes to control the Shadow Volumes.
An example of this use can be seen in the next image.
