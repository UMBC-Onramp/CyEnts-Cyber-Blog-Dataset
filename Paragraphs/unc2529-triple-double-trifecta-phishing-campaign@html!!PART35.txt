Plugin Management The backdoor's core functionality is implemented via plugins designed as PE Windows dynamic libraries.
The plugins, as with the other backdoor components, are also saved in the registry database under a host-specific registry key.
The full path to the plugins location is formatted as HK[LM|CU]:\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{ <plugins_home_guid> }, where <plugins_home_guid> is generated by the GUID algorithm shown in Figure 11 with a host-specific value we call implant ID which is used not only to generate the path to the plugins but with the backdoorâ€™s C2 communications and it is also passed as a parameter to each of the plugins during their initialization.
