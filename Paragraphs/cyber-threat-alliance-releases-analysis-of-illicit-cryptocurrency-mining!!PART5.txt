XMRig is a legitimate tool for mining Monero, yet is also frequently used by malicious actors for illicit cryptomining.
The most common browser-based miner is Coinhive.
Used legitimately, it offers an alternative to ad revenue by monetizing system resources.
However, it has been widely used without informing users.
On occasion the owner of the service is unaware of the mining code; this was the case with a recent attack against both Facebook Messenger and Starbucks Wi-Fi.
