The EarthLink Botnet accounted for 25% of all email spam at the time, about 1.25 billion messages in total.
Because of this brazen campaign, it landed an unprecedented judgment against its operator Khan C. Smith for USD$25 million.
However, the GTbot was introduced in 1999, making it the actual first botnet.
In terms of malware, it was very rudimentary.
It essentially spread itself to other machines and received commands via IRC.
These commands were issued by GTbot controllers, who used this network of affected devices (known as zombies) to launch distributed denial-of-service ( DDoS ) attacks.
