Build a PDB classifier as a weak signal for binary analysis.
To start, we began gathering data.
Our dataset, pulled from internal and external sources, started with over 200,000 samples.
Once we deduplicated by PDB path, we had around 50,000 samples.
Next, we needed to consistently label these samples, so we considered various labeling schemes.
Labeling Binaries With PDB Paths For many of the binaries we had internal FireEye labels, and for others we looked up hashes on VirusTotal (VT) to have a look at their detection rates.
This covered the majority of our samples.
For a relatively small subset we had disagreements between our internal engine and VT results, which merited a slightly more nuanced policy.
The disagreement was most often that our internal assessment determined a file to be benign, but the VT results showed a nonzero percentage of vendors detecting the file as malicious.
In these cases we plotted the ‘VT ratio”: that is, the percentage of vendors labeling the files as malicious (Figure 1).
