Diplomacy Malware continues to play a key role in espionage in the Internet era.
Here are some examples that stood out this year: The Snowden documents revealed that NSA and GCHQ deployed key logging malware during the G20 meeting in 2009.
In fact, G20 meetings have long been targets for foreign intelligence services, including this yearâ€™s G20 meeting in Russia.
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) and The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) are also frequent targets.
