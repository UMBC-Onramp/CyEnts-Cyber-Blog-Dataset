Mandiant Threat Intelligence has previously documented this threat in our investigations of trends across ransomware incidents , FIN6 activity , implications for OT networks , and other aspects of post-compromise ransomware deployment.
Since November 2019, weâ€™ve seen the MAZE ransomware being used in attacks that combine targeted ransomware use, public exposure of victim data, and an affiliate model.
Malicious actors have been actively deploying MAZE ransomware since at least May 2019.
The ransomware was initially distributed via spam emails and exploit kits before later shifting to being deployed post-compromise.
