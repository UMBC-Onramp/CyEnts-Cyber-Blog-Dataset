And finally, I elaborated on what kind of data Emotet collects from the victim’s system and how the binary data is encrypted and converted into base64 string and finally submitted to its C2 server via an HTTP packet.
In the next part of this analysis, I will focus on those returned modules from Emotet’s C2 server and how they are executed by Emotet, as well as what sensitive data they are able to steal from the victim’s device.
Please stay tuned.
