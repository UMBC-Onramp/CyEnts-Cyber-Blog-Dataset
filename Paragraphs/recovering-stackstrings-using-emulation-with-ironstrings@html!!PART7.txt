The combination of both tools is powered by flare-emu .
Fe , short for flare-emu , is the chemical symbol for iron and hence the script is named ironstrings .
To recover stackstrings, ironstrings enumerates all disassembled functions in a program except for library and thunk functions as identified by IDA Pro.
For each function, the script emulates various code paths through the function and searches for stackstrings based on two heuristics:
Before all call instructions in the function.
As stackstrings are often constructed and then passed to other functions, i.e. Windows APIs like CreateFile or InternetOpenUrl .
At the end of a basic block containing more than five memory writes.
The number of memory writes is configurable.
This heuristic is helpful if the same memory buffer is used multiple times in a function and if the string construction spans multiple basic blocks.
If any of these conditions apply, the script searches the functionâ€™s current stack frame for printable ASCII and UTF-16 strings.
