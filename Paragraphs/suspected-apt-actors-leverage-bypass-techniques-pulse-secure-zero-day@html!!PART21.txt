The file meeting_testjs.cgi (SHA256: 133631957d41eed9496ac2774793283ce26f8772de226e7f520d26667b51481a ) is a webshell capable of arbitrary file read, write, and command execution.
Malicious logic is inserted at the end of legitimate logic to respond to POST requests.
We believe this webshell may be responsible for placing additional webshells and used to modify legitimate system components resulting in the other observed malware families due to its functionality.
The malicious logic inserts a branch condition to respond to HTTP POST requests rather than just the typical GET requests expected of the legitimate code.
If GET requests are performed the legitimate logic is still invoked.
POST requests have a series of parameters checked for existence to determine which command to invoke.
