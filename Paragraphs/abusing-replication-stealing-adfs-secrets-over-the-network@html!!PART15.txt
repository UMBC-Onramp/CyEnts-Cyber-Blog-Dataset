to extract the Token Signing Certificate from a remote AD FS server.

The best mitigation against this technique is to use the Windows Firewall to restrict access to port 80 TCP to only the AD FS servers in the farm.
If an organization has only a single AD FS server, then port 80 TCP can be blocked completely.
This block can be put in place because all traffic to and from AD FS servers and proxies for user authentication is over port 443 TCP.
To limit inbound communications, modify the existing firewall rule that AD FS inserts on installation.
Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"AD FS HTTP Services (TCP-In)\" -RemoteAddress <ADFS1 IP address>,<ADFS2 IP Address>
If no rule exists, the scriptlet in Figure 5 should be applied to all ADFS servers to create one.
