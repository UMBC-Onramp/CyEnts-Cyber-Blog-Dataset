FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Report Affected Platforms: Linux Impacted Users: Any organization Impact: Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systems Severity Level:
Critical Last week, our FortiGuard Labs team encountered a malware sample that’s currently being distributed in the wild targeting TP-link wireless routers.
It leverages a recently post-authenticated RCE vulnerability released barely two weeks prior.
As it turns out, it is an updated variant of the MANGA campaign (also known as Dark) that distributes samples based on Mirai’s published source code.
This Mirai-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) botnet campaign is one that FortiGuard Labs has been actively monitoring .
