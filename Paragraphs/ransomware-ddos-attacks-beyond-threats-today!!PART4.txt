This increases the chances of detection and identification of security risks outside the network perimeter.
MITM Attacks The rising use of remote connections has created a perfect storm for man-in-the-middle (MITM) malware attacks.
This type of attack listens in on digital connections and could exfiltrate key data.
Often designed for minimal impact, these attacks can go unnoticed for weeks or months.
In the past, the fear around MITM attacks has been the risk of data eavesdropping.
People feared threat actors could capture unencrypted data, such as plaintext emails, and then use it to compromise systems at scale.
