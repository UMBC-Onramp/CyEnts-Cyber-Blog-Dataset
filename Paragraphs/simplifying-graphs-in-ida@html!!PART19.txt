* IDASDK: path to the extracted IDA 7.0 (or newer) SDK.
This Should have `include` and `lib` paths beneath it.
* BOOSTDIR: path to the extracted Boost library.
Should have `boost` and `libs` paths beneath it.
The easiest way is to use the Microsoft command-line build tools: * For IDA7.0:
Launch VS2013 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt, then run: ``` msbuild SimplifyGraph.sln /property:
Configuration=
ReleaseIDA70_32 /property:
Platform=x64 msbuild SimplifyGraph.sln /property:
Configuration=ReleaseIDA70_64 /property:
Platform=x64
``` * For IDA6.95: Launch VS2013 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt, then run: ``` msbuild SimplifyGraph.sln /property:
Configuration=ReleaseIDA695_32 /property:
Platform=Win32
msbuild SimplifyGraph.sln /property:
Configuration=ReleaseIDA695_64 /property:
