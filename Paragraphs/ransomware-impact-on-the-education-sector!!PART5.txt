The Grief gang recently stepped their tactics up a notch.
Their new ransom message threatens to erase the decryption key necessary to recover encrypted files if the victim contacts law enforcement or a professional ransom negotiator.
This essentially makes Grief a wiper malware in addition to beingransomware.
According to one report , ransomware attacks affected nearly 1,800 schools in the US during 2020, impacting over 1.3 million students.
Ransoms during that time ranged from $10,000 to over $1 million per incident and cost educational institutions an additional $6.62 billion in downtime.
