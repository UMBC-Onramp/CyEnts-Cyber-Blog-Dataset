The function at the bottom submits the stolen credentials.
These functions obtain the saved credentials for each software from the different places they are save their credentials, including local files (like Chrome) and system registry (like Outlook), etc.
I will now use Outlook as an example to explain how Snake Keylogger collects credentials.
Figure 4.5 is a screenshot of a function that is about to read the credentials of Microsoft Outlook from the system registry.
It goes through four registry paths for different Outlook versions to read out (if applicable) “Email” and \"IMAP Password\" or \"POP3 Password\" or \"HTTP Password\" or \"SMTP Password\" and “SMTP Server”.
