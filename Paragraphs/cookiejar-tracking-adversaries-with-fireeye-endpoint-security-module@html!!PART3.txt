Logon Trackerâ€™s graphical display along with the raw logon events allowed Mandiant Managed Defense to quickly identify 10 potentially compromised hosts and begin to create a timeline of adversary activity.
Managed Defense also leveraged Logon Tracker to monitor for additional suspicious logons and adversary activity throughout the incident response.
Searching for logons (both failed and successful) from known compromised accounts and activity originating from compromised systems allowed our investigators to quickly determine which systems should be prioritized for analysis.
