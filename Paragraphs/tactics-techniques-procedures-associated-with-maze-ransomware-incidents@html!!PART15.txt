Over a period of several days, an actor conducted reconnaissance activity using Bloodhound, PowerSploit/PowerView (Invoke-ShareFinder), and a reconnaissance script designed to enumerate directories across internal hosts.
An actor employed the adfind tool and a batch script to collect information about their network, hosts, domain, and users.
The output from this batch script (2adfind.bat) was saved into an archive named 'ad.7z' using an instance of the 7zip archiving utility named 7.exe .
An actor used the tool smbtools.exe to assess whether accounts could login to systems across the environment.
