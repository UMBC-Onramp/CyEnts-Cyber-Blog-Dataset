Who did it?
This pursuit is understandable yet fundamentally flawed.
Attribution is crucial, but there will always be unanswered questions.
Our approach focuses on answering the What and How questions by analyzing the malware, the infrastructure involved, and the incident response performed at the victimâ€™s site.
Our approach is always to analyze competing hypotheses.
When investigating an incident, we form several views and compare all the artifacts to support these hypotheses.
We try not only to seek verifying evidence but also actively try to find evidence that falsifies a hypothesis.
Keeping our eyes open for falsifying facts and constantly questioning our results are essential steps to avoid conformation bias.
