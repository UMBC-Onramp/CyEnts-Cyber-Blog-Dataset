When providing the function a valid UserPrincipalName, Immutable ID and IssuerURI, an attacker can generate a security token as any user of the tenant.
What’s even more concerning is that once this security token is generated, this can allow an attacker to bypass MFA.
As with Backdoor 1, this attack can either be performed from a compromised on-premises environment or from an attacker’s own infrastructure.
Method 1: On-Premises Compromise Once an attacker has gained access to an on-premises domain with elevated access, they can begin to collect the required information to craft their own security tokens to backdoor into M365 as any user.
An attacker will require: A valid UserPrincipalName and Immutable.
Both of these attributes can be pulled from the on-premises Active Directory domain.
