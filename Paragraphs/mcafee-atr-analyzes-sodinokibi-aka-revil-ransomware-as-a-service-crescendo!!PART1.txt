Crescendo This is the final installment of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) analysis of Sodinokibi and its connections to GandGrab, the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Campaign of 2018 and mid 2019.
In this final episode of our series we will zoom in on the operations, techniques and tools used by different affiliate groups spreading Sodinokibi ransomware.
Since May we have observed several different modus operandi by different affiliates, for example: Distributing the ransomware using spear-phishing and weaponized documents Bat-files downloading payloads from Pastebin and inject them into a process on the operating system Compromising RDP and usage of script files and password cracking tools to distribute over the victimâ€™s network Compromise of Managed Service Providers and usage of their distribution software to spread the ransomware To understand more about how this enemy operates, we in McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) decided to operate a global network of honeypots.
