NitlovePOS uses this feature to store payment card information; the mailslot name that is created comes as a hardcoded string in the binary (once de-obfuscated); \"\\\\.\\mailslot\\95d292040d8c4e31ac54a93ace198142\" Once the mailslot is created, an infinite loop will keep querying the allocated space.
Thread 3:
Memory Scrapping NitlovePOS scans running processes for payment data and but will skip System and “System Idle Process.”
It will try to match track 1 or track 2 data and, if found, will write the data into the mailslot created by Thread 2.
This information is then sent via POST it to the C2 using SSL, which makes network-level detection more difficult.
Possible Control Panel During our research we observed what appears to be a test control panel on a different, but probably related, server that matches with NitlovePOS.
This panel is called “nitbot,” which is similar to the “nit_love” string found in the binary and was located in a directory called “derpmo” which is similar to the “derpos” used in this case.
