Both GM Bot and SlemBunk samples share the same architecture.
Figure 3 shows the major code of class SDCardServiceStarter to demonstrate how GM Bot and SlemBunk use the same mechanism to keep MainService running.
Figure 3.
Method onReceive of SDCardServiceStarter for GM Bot and SlemBunk From this figure, we can see that GM Bot and SlemBunk use almost identical code to keep MainService running.
Note that both samples check the country in system locale and avoid starting MainService when they find the country is Russia.
The only difference is that GM Bot applies renaming obfuscation to some classes, methods and fields.
For example, static variable “MainService;->a” in GM Bot has the same role as static variable “MainService;->isRunning” in SlemBunk.
Malware authors commonly use this trick to make their code harder to understand.
However this won’t change the fact that the underlying codes share the same origin.
Figure 4 shows the core code of class MainService to demonstrate that GM Bot and SlemBunk actually have the same logic for main service.
