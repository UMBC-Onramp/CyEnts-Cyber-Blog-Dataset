The Techniques Meltdown and Spectre are new techniques that build upon previous work, such as “KASLR” and other papers that discuss practical side-channel attacks.
The current disclosures build upon such side-channel attacks through the innovative use of speculative execution.
Speculative execution has been a feature of processors for at least a decade.
Branch speculation is built on the Tomasulo algorithm .
In essence, when a branch in execution depends upon a runtime condition, modern processors make a “guess” to potentially save time.
This speculatively executed branch proceeds by employing a guess of the value of the condition upon which the branch must depend.
That guess is typically based upon the last step of the same branch’s previous execution.
The conditional value is cached for reuse in case that particular branch is taken again.
