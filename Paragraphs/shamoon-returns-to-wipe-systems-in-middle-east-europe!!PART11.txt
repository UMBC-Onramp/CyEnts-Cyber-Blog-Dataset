Conclusion Aside from the major destruction this malware can cause, the wiper component can be used independently from the dropper.
The wiper does not have to rely on the main stub process.
The 2018 Shamoon variant’s functionality indicates modular development.
This enables the wiper to be used by malware droppers other than Shamoon.
Shamoon is showing signs of evolution; however, these advancements did not escape detection by McAfee DATs.
We expect to see additional attacks in the Middle East (and beyond) by these adversaries.
We will continue to monitor our telemetry and will update this analysis as we learn more.
