This strategy allows them to orchestrate multiple threats instead of just one to reach their goals.
An example is worth a thousand words Imagine an attack that starts with a phishing threatâ€”not a typical campaign using Word documents, but a novel technique.
This phishing email contains a video attachment.
When you open the video, your video player does not play and prompts you to update the codec.
Once you run the update, a steganographic polyglot file (a simple GIF) is deployed on your system.
Because it is a polyglot (a file that conforms to more than one format at the same time), the GIF file schedules a task that fetches a fileless script hosted on a compromised system.
That script running in memory evaluates your system and decides to run either ransomware or a cryptocurrency miner.
That is a dangerous synergistic threat in action.
The attack raises many questions: What are you dealing with?
