The term “BEC” typically refers to a type of fraud committed by financially motivated attackers.
BEC actors heavily rely on social engineering to carry out their schemes, ultimately defrauding organizations and even personnel.
One common BEC scheme involves compromising a C-suite executive’s account via phishing.
Once the victim unwittingly enters their credentials into a web form masquerading as the legitimate Office 365 login portal, attackers log in and instruct others in the organization to conduct a wire transfer, perhaps under the guise of an upcoming acquisition that has yet to be publicly announced.
However, we’ve also observed more effective schemes where attackers compromise those in financial positions and patiently wait until an email correspondence has begun about a due payment.
Attackers seize this opportunity by sending a doctored invoice (sometimes based on a legitimate invoice that had been stolen earlier) on behalf of the compromised user to another victim responsible for making payments.
