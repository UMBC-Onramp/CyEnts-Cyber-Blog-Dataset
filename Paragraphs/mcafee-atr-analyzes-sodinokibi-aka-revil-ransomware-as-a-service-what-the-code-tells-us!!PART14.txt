FIGURE 7.
CHECK IF OS IS 32- OR 64-BIT In the case that the field was false, or the exploit is patched, the malware will check the OS version again using the PEB.
If the OS is Windows Vista, at least it will get from the own process token the level of execution privilege.
When the discovered privilege level is less than 0x3000 (that means that the process is running as a real administrator in the system or SYSTEM), it will relaunch the process using the ‘runas’ command to elevate to 0x3000 process from 0x2000 or 0x1000 level of execution.
