Screenshot of VBA code from System.doc The spreadsheet also creates a scheduled task named \"windows update check\" that runs the file C:\\Users\\<user_name>\\.templates\\System Manager.exe every minute.
Upon closing the spreadsheet, a final VBA function will rename System.doc to System Manager.exe .
Figure 3 provides a snippet of VBA code that creates the scheduled task, clearly obfuscated to avoid simple detection.
