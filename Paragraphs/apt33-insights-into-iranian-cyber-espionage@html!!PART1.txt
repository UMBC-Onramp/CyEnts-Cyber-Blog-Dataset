When discussing suspected Middle Eastern hacker groups with destructive capabilities, many automatically think of the suspected Iranian group that previously used SHAMOON – aka Disttrack – to target organizations in the Persian Gulf.
However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call APT33.
Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013.
We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government.
Recent investigations by FireEye’s Mandiant incident response consultants combined with FireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence analysis have given us a more complete picture of APT33’s operations, capabilities, and potential motivations.
This blog highlights some of our analysis.
Our detailed report on FireEye Threat Intelligence contains a more thorough review of our supporting evidence and analysis.
