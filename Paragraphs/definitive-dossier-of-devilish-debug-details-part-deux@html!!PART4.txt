Ratio of vendors calling file bad/total number of vendors The vast majority of these samples had VT detection ratios below 0.3, and in those cases we labeled the binaries as benign.
For the remainder of samples we tried two strategies â€“ marking them all as malicious, or removing them from the training set entirely.
Our classification performance did not change much between these two policies, so in the end we scrapped the remainder of the samples to reduce label noise.
