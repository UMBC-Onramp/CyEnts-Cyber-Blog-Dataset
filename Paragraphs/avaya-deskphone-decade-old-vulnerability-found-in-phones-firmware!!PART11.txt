This type of test point, where the copper is directly exposed, is commonly used during the manufacturing process to program the device or verify everything is working properly.
UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter and is meant for two-way communication.
This is the most likely place where we can find the administrative access we are looking for.
By buying a $15 cable that converts UART to USB and soldering wires onto the test pads, we can see debug information being printed on screen when the phone boots up, but soon the flow of debug information dries up.
This is a curious behavior—why stop the debug messages?—so we need to investigate more.
By using a disassembler to convert raw bytes into computer instructions, we can peek into the code of the bootloader recovered earlier and find out that during the boot process the phone fetches settings from external memory to decide whether the full set of debug features should be enabled on the serial console.
