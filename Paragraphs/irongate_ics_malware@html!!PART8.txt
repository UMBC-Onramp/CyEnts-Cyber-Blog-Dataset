Implications for ICS Asset Owners Even though process operators face no increased risk from the currently identified members of the IRONGATE malware family, IRONGATE provides valuable insight into adversary mindset.
Network security monitoring, indicator of compromise (IoC) matching, and good practice guidance from vendors and other stakeholders represent important defensive techniques for ICS networks.
To specifically counter IRONGATE’s process attack techniques, ICS asset owners may, over the longer term, implement solutions that: Require integrity checks and code signing for vendor and user generated code.
Lacking cryptographic verification facilitates file replacement and MitM attacks against controlled industrial processes.
Develop mechanisms for sanity checking IO data, such as independent sensing and backhaul, and comparison with expected process state information.
Ignorance of expected process state facilitates an attacker’s ability to achieve physical consequence without alarming operators.
Technical Malware Analysis IRONGATE Dropper Family FireEye has identified six IRONGATE droppers: bla.exe, update.exe 1 , update_no_pipe.exe 1, update_no_pipe.exe 2 , update_no_pipe.exe 2 , update.exe 3 .
