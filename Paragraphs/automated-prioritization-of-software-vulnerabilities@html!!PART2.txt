However, it has been criticized for a lack of timeliness, vulnerable population representation, normalization, rescoring and broader expert consensus that can lead to disagreements .
For example, some of the worst exploits have been assigned low CVSS scores.
Additionally, CVSS does not measure the vulnerable population size, which many practitioners have stated they expect it to score.
The design of the current CVSS system leads to too many severe vulnerabilities, which causes user fatigue.
­ To provide a more timely and broad approach, we use machine learning to analyze users’ opinions about the severity of vulnerabilities by examining relevant tweets.
The model predicts whether users believe a vulnerability is likely to affect a large number of people, or if the vulnerability is less dangerous and unlikely to be exploited.
