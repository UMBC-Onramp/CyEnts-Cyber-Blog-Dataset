Second, we describe a new security issue with the JavaScript binding annotation, which we call JavaScript Sidedoor.
Starting with Android 4.2, Google introduced the @JavascriptInterface annotation to explicitly designate and limit which public methods in Java objects are accessible from JavaScript.
If an ad library uses @JavascriptInterface annotation to expose security-sensitive interfaces, and uses HTTP to load content in the WebView, then an attacker over the network could inject malicious content into the WebView to misuse the exposed interfaces through the JS binding annotation.
We call these exposed JS binding annotation interfaces JS sidedoors .
Our analysis shows that these security issues are widespread, have affected popular apps on Google Play accounting for literally billions of app downloads.
