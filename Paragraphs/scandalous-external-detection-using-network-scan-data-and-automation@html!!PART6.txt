For example, our team identified the server 185.161.208\\.37 and domain rdppath\\.com within hours of it being established.
A week later, we identified a QUADAGENT dropper with the previously identified C2.
Additional examples of QUADAGENT are depicted in Figure 1.
Figure 1:
QUADAGENT C2 servers in the Shodan user interface Five days after the QUADAGENT dropper was identified, Mandiant was engaged by a victim that was targeted via the same C2.
This activity was later attributed to APT34.
During the investigation, Mandiant uncovered APT34 using RULER.HOMEPAGE.
This was the first time our consultants observed the tool and technique used in the wild by a real threat actor.
Our team developed a profile of servers hosting HOMEPAGE payloads and began tracking their deployment in the wild.
Figure 2 shows a timeline of QUADAGENT C2 servers discovered between February and November of 2018.
