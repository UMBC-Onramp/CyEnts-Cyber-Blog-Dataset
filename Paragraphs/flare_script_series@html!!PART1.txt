Introduction We are expanding our script series beyond IDA Pro.
This post extends the FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE) script series to an invaluable tool for the reverse engineer – the debugger.
Just like IDA Pro, debuggers have scripting interfaces.
For example, OllyDbg uses an asm-like scripting language, the Immunity debugger contains a Python interface, and Windbg has its own language.
Each of these options isn’t ideal for rapidly creating string decoding debugger scripts.
Both Immunity and OllyDbg only support 32-bit applications, and Windbg’s scripting language is specific to Windbg and, therefore, not as well-known.
The pykd project was created to interface between Python and Windbg to allow debugger scripts to be written in Python.
Because malware reverse engineers love Python, we built our debugger scripting library on top of pykd for Windbg.
