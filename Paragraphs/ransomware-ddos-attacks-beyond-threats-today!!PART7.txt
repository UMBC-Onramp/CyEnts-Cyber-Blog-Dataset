For cyber criminals, DDoS offers a low-cost, high-return attack type.
IoT devices are cheap, plentiful and many are easy to compromise thanks to minimal or non-existent factory security settings.
Companies are often willing to pay once they realize online services won’t be coming back up anytime soon unless the attackers turn down the traffic.
The result is a frightening scenario for enterprises.
Sudden, high-volume attacks from disparate sources could knock critical services offline for days or weeks.
That, in turn, leads to major revenue and reputation loss.
When it comes to defending against DDoS attacks, two components are critical.
First is preparation.
These attacks are a matter of when, not if.
Companies need incident response plans in place that find potential weak points, critical control mechanisms and simple ways of reducing their impact — such as blocking traffic from specific locations.
