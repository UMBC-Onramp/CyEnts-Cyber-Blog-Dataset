Introduction We’re proud to release a new plug-in for IDA Pro users – SimplifyGraph – to help automate creation of groups of nodes in the IDA’s disassembly graph view.
Code and binaries are available from the FireEye GitHub repo .
Prior to this release we submitted it in the 2017 Hex-Rays plugin contest , where it placed third overall.
My personal preference is to use IDA’s graph mode when doing the majority of my reverse engineering.
It provides a graphical representation of the control flow graph and gives visual cues about the structure of the current function that helps me better understand the disassembly.
