In that context, FortiGuard Labs has observed new threat samples targeting the 2021 Tokyo Olympic games.
It includes a wiper component, which, if successful, could cause a disruption to targeted machines.
Background The most recent attack targeting the Olympics was documented during the 2018 Winter Games.
The lure was a malicious Word document titled, \" Russian figure skater won the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in South Korea.doc.\"
Once the user opened the document, the sample called and dropped a backdoor component, called Icefog.
First discovered in 2013, the Icefog backdoor was used to attack sectors in the APAC region, with a focus on Japan and South Korea.
The threat actor group responsible for Icefog is very methodical.
Targets are carefully chosen, and the group seems to know what they are after beforehand.
Icefog leveraged CVE-2012-0158—a older vulnerability in Windows common controls—relying on the fact that many system administrators, especially those in organizations with a large number of computers (governments, NGOs, companies, various organizations, etc.), often find patching cumbersome.
Because of this, older exploits such as this are often a successfully exploited vector, even though this particular vulnerability was over 6 years old at the time of the attack.
Fast forward to today, and in the wee hours of the Tokyo Olympic Games an interesting Wiper malware surfaced that reminded us of the same destructive malware that targeted the Pyeongchang Winter Games.
This one is called “Olympic Destroyer.”
Its file name is “【至急】東京オリンピック開催に伴うサイバー攻撃等発生に関する被害報告について.exe” (English translation: “(Urgent) Damage report in relation with cyber attacks targeting the Tokyo Olympics Games.exe”.
