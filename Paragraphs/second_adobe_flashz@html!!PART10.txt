Recommendations FireEye maintains endpoint and network detection for CVE-2015-5122 and the backdoor used in this campaign.
FireEye products and services identify this activity as SOGU/Kaba within the user interface.
Additionally, we highly recommend:
Applying Adobe’s newest patch for Flash immediately; Querying for additional activity by the indicators from the compromised Japanese websites and the SOGU malware callbacks; Blocking CnC addresses via outbound communications; and Scope the environment to prepare for incident response.
