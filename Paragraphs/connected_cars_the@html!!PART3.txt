In contrast to ransomware that infects ordinary computer systems, vehicles are more likely susceptible to ransomware attacks when their disablement causes knock-on effects.
For example, where a single driver might be able to reinstall his carâ€™s software with the help of a mechanic to remedy a ransomware infection, a group of vehicles disabled on a busy highway could cause far more serious disruption.
Victims or municipal authorities may have little choice but to pay the ransom to reopen a busy commuting route.
