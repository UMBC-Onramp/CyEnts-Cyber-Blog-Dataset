Nation-states leverage bot battalions to deliver messages or manipulate opinion, and their effectiveness is striking.
Bots often will take both sides of a story to spur debate, and this tactic works.
By employing a system of amplifying nodes, as well as testing the messaging (including hashtags) to determine success rates, botnet operators demonstrate a real understanding of how to mold popular opinion on critical issues.
In one example, an account that was only two weeks old with 279 followers, most of which were other bots, began a harassment campaign against an organization.
By amplification, the account generated an additional 1,500 followers in only four weeks by simply tweeting malicious content about their target.
Activities to manipulate public opinion have been well documented and bots well versed in manipulating conversations to drive agendas stand ready.
