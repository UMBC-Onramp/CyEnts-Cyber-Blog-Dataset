The relationship between these different authors is still unclear.
What we are certain about is that this variant is being actively operated, as also shown by recently updated binaries found in one of its download servers.
SORA - The Surviving Member of the Wicked Family
It is also interesting to see Mirai variants that were authored by the threat actor known as Wicked that we covered three years ago.
These variants include Owari, Omni, Wicked, and SORA.
Based on an interview at that time, the author stated he was going to focus on Owari and Omni while abandoning the other two variants, including SORA.
Based on our observastions, it seems that SORA has more successfully survived than its siblings.

In particular, we have been closely monitoring the developments of the MANGA variant because it is one of the most active in terms of adding new exploit vectors to its list.
