What is APKPure for?
The most official of all Android app stores is, of course, Google Play.
But it is available only on devices that use Google Mobile Services (GMS) and are firmly tied to Google’s infrastructure.
Some vendors avoid GMS libraries to stay independent, and because Android is an open operating system, they can.
For users, there are both advantages and disadvantages.
One prominent disadvantage is a loss of access to Google’s app store, where Android users can download the usual apps.
