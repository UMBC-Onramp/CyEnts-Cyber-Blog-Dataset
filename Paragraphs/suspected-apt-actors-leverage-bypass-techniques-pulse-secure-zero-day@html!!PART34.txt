Case 11 of the switch statement typically calls the routines DSMap::setPrivacyKeyNames then DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSecondaryAuth .
The malicious logic in this variant overwrites the call to DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSecondaryAuth with mov eax, 1.
This forces application flow as if DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSecondaryAuth always succeeds, without ever calling it.
We were not able to recover a file with these patches applied as the attacker removed their patches after use.
