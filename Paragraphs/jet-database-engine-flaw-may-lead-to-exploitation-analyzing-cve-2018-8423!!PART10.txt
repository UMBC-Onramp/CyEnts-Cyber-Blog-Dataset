The logic: Allocate the memory and get the pointer to the start of the memory location.
From the start of memory location +574h, the program saves pointers to index names with each occupying 4 bytes multiplied by the index number mentioned in the file.
If the index number is very large, as in this case, and no validation is done, then the program will try to write out of bounds and crash.
