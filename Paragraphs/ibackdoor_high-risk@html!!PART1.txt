Introduction Recently FireEye mobile researchers discovered a high-risk ad\nlibrary embedded in thousands of iOS apps in the Apple App Store,\nincluding 213 popular apps with more than 1000 user reviews in both\nthe US and Chinese App Stores.
As of publication of this blog, 935\naffected apps are still downloadable.
The capabilities of this ad\nlibrary go far beyond those of typical adware and clearly violate\nrequirements of Apple’s iOS Developer Program intended to protect\nusers’ security and privacy.
The library embeds backdoors in unsuspecting apps that make use of it to display ads, exposing sensitive data and functionality.
The backdoors can be controlled remotely by loading JavaScript code from remote servers to perform the following actions: Capture audio and screenshots.
Monitor and upload device location.
Read/delete/create/modify files in the app’s data container.
Read/Write/Reset the app’s keychain (e.g., app password storage).
