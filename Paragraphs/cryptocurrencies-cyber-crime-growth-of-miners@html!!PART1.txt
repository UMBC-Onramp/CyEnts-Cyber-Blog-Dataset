Introduction Cyber criminals tend to favor cryptocurrencies because they provide a certain level of anonymity and can be easily monetized.
This interest has increased in recent years , stemming far beyond the desire to simply use cryptocurrencies as a method of payment for illicit tools and services.
Many actors have also attempted to capitalize on the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, and subsequent rising price, by conducting various operations aimed at them.
These operations include malicious cryptocurrency mining (also referred to as cryptojacking), the collection of cryptocurrency wallet credentials, extortion activity, and the targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges.
