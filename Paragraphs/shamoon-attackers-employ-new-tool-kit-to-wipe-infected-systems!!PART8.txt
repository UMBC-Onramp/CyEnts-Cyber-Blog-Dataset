To spread the wipers, the attackers included an additional spreader using Psexec.exe, an administration tool used to remotely execute commands.
The only difference is that this spreader uses psexec, which is supposed to be stored in Net2 on the spreading machine.
It could be used on additional machines to move the malware further.
The wiper contains three options: SilentMode:
Runs the wiper without any output.
BypassAcl: Escalates privileges.
It is always enabled.
PrintStackTrace:
Tracks the number of folders and files erased.
The BypassAcl option is always “true” even if the option is not specified.
