We were aware of the lively underground trade market of RDP credentials and were curious about what someone would do with a compromised machine.
Would they distribute the Sodinokibi ransomware?
Would they execute the DejaBlue or BlueKeep exploits?
Our specially designed and built RDP honeypots would give us those insights.
Like Moths to a Flame From June until September 2019, we observed several groups compromise our honey pots and conduct activities related to Sodinokibi; we were able to fully monitor attackers and their actions without their knowledge.
It is important to note the golden rule we operated under: the moment criminal actions were prepared or about to be executed, the actor would be disconnected and the machine would be restored to its original settings with a new IP address.
