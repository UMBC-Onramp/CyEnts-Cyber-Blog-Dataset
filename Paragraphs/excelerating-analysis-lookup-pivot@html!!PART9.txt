We want to return the “Latitude” value for the given IP address, so in the aforementioned example, we tell Excel to return data from column 2.
Range lookup (match type)
This part of the formula tells Excel what type of matching to perform on the value being looked up.
Excel defaults to “Approximate” matching, which assumes the data is sorted and will match the closest value.
We want to perform “Exact” matching, so we put “0” here (“FALSE” is also accepted).
With the VLOOKUP function complete for the “Latitude” data, we can use the fill handle to update this field for the rest of the data set.
