With the help of eBay, we purchased both a patient monitor and a compatible central monitoring station at a reasonable cost.
The patient monitor monitored heartbeat, oxygen level, and blood pressure.
It has both wired and wireless networking and appeared to store patient information.
The central monitoring station ran Windows XP Embedded, with two Ethernet ports, and ran in a limited kiosk mode at start-up.
Both units were produced around 2004; several local hospitals confirmed that these models are still in use.
The two devices offer a range of potential attack surfaces.
The central monitoring station operates fundamentally like a desktop computer running Windows XP, which has been extensively researched by the security community.
The application running on the central monitoring station is old; if we found a vulnerability, it would likely be tied to the legacy operating system.
