The code snippet below is used to run “schtasks” command with the “/create” option to create a new scheduled task, as shown in Figure 3.1.
It executes a VBScript code within a remote HTML file, then downloads the Agent Tesla payload to run on the victim’s system.
It also detects and kills any other Agent Tesla process instances already running.
This allows it to perform its upgrading function.

 Persistence – StartMenu Startup:
A standalone VBS file, “%Public%\\ hulalalMCROSOFT.vbs ”, extracted from VBScript-embedded-in-HTML downloads another base64-encoded VBS file from “hxxps[:]//bitbucket[.]org/!api/2.0/snippets/hogya/5X7My8/b271c1b3c7a78e7b68fa388ed463c7cc1dc32ddb/files/divine1-2” into a local file.
Going through the base64-decoded code, it saves the VBS code to a file called “UYA-update.vbs“ located under %Public% folder.
This standalone VBS file downloads the Agent Tesla payload and deploys it on the victim’s system.
As a result, whenever the VBS file is executed it starts Agent Tesla.
To keep Agent Tesla alive on the victim’s system, it copies the downloaded standalone VBS file “UYA-update.vbs” into the StartMenu’s Startup folder and renames it as “GTQ.vbs”.
This allows it to start automatically when the system starts.
Figure 3.2 displays the Startup folder with the copied “GTQ.vbs”.

 Perform process-hollowing: “UYA-update.vbs” continues to craft a piece of PowerShell code within a base64-decoded PE file from a local variable.
