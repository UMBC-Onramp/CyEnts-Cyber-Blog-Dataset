version – The internal version number of the malware.
Version 4 had significant changes overall and we believe that these changes were partly done by the authors to improve administration and make GandCrab more scalable to cope with its increased popularity.
Based on the hardcoded values it was possible for us, to a certain extent, to extract the administration information and create our own overview.
We hunted for as many different GandCrab samples as we could find, using Yara rules, industry contacts and customer submissions.
The sample list we gathered is quite extensive but not exhaustive.
From the collected samples we extracted the hardcoded values and compile times automatically, using a custom build tool.
We aggregated all these values together in one giant timeline from GandCrab version 4, all the way up to version 5.2.

ID and SUB_ID Characteristics Observed Parent-Child Relationship
The extracted ID’s and Sub_IDs showed a parent-child relationship, meaning every ID could have more than one SUB_ID (child) but every SUB_ID only had one ID (parent).
