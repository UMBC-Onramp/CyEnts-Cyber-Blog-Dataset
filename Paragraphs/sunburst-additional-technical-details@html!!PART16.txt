SUNBURST starts a thread to handle command execution and further C2 HTTP(S) callouts.
As an investigator, if you see CNAME resolutions for subdomains of avsvmcloud[.]com, it‘s possible that UNC2452 initiated follow-on C2 within the environment.
Note, the malware must receive a DNS A record response pointing to one of the following subnets immediately prior to receiving a DNS CNAME response.
Otherwise, the CNAME resolution will be ignored and treated as an error.
In addition, for these subnets, the least-significant bytes from the A record IP address are parsed to obtain configuration data such as the proxy method to use, the URI scheme to use, and a delay value used in the HTTP thread.
18.130.0.0/16 99.79.0.0/16 184.72.0.0/15
Subsequent DNS A record responses in the following subnet ranges cause the DGA beaconing to continue.
8.18.144.0/23 18.130.0.0/16 71.152.53.0/24 99.79.0.0/16 87.238.80.0/21 199.201.117.0/24 184.72.0.0/15
Otherwise, subsequent DNS A record responses in the following subnet ranges cause SUNBURST to terminate and update the configuration key ReportWatcherRetry to a value that prevents further execution.
This is the killswitch.

While in “active” mode, the DGA subdomain encoding does not include victim machine domain name information.
