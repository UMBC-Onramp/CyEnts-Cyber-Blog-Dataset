Possibly the biggest story of 2021 — an investigation by the Guardian and 16 other media organizations, published in July — suggested that over 30,000 human rights activists, journalists and lawyers across the world may have been targeted using Pegasus.
Pegasus is a so-called “legal surveillance software” developed by the Israeli company NSO.
The report, called the Pegasus Project , alleged that the malware was deployed widely through a variety of exploits, including several iOS zero-click zero-days.
Based on forensic analysis of numerous mobile devices, Amnesty International’s Security Lab found that the software was repeatedly used in an abusive manner for surveillance.
The list of targeted individuals includes 14 world leaders and many other activists, human rights advocates, dissidents and opposition figures.
Later in July, representatives from the Israeli government visited the offices of NSO as part of an investigation into the claims.
In October, India’s Supreme Court commissioned a technical committee to investigate the use of Pegasus to spy on its citizens.
Apple announced, in November, that it was taking legal action against NSO Group for developing software that targets its users with “malicious malware and spyware.”
Last but not least, in December, Reuters published that US State Department phones were hacked with the NSO Pegasus malware, as alerted by Apple.
