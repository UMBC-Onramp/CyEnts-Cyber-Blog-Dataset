Finally, we discovered a way to bypass and evade application security controls to exploit multiple reflected cross-site scripting issues on multiple endpoints.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by constructing a request with an injected malicious payload in the vulnerable parameters and deceive the logged-in users to visit it.
The malicious payload injected by the attacker is executed within the victim’s browser, in the context of that victim’s session.
The malicious application allows the attacker to hijack the user session and redirect the victim to an attacker-controlled domain or another client-side attack.
That might be in-browser keylogging or performing arbitrary actions within the context of the application.
We also discovered sensitive information disclosure in one of the application endpoints.
This could allow an authenticated attacker to disclose users’ hashed passwords, which could then be recovered using a dictionary attack.
