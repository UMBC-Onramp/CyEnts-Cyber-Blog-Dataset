EEPROM ready to be re-programmed Rebooting the phones gives us much more debug information and, eventually, we are greeted with the root shell we were after.
Confirmation we have a root shell.
Unrelated debug messages are being printed while we are invoking the “whoami” command Alternative Roads The approach described above is fairly lengthy and is only interesting to security researchers in a similar situation.
A more generic technique would be to directly modify the filesystem by altering the flash storage (a NAND Flash on the back of the circuit board) as we did for previous research , and then automatically start an SSH server or a remote shell.
