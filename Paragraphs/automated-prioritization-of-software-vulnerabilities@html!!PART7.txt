The rationale is that eventual presence in these lists indicates not just that exploits can exist or that they do exist, but that they also are publicly available.
Modeling Approach Predicting the CVSS scores and exploitability from Twitter data involves multiple steps.
First, we need to find appropriate representations (or features) for our natural language to be processed by machine learning models.
In this work, we use two natural language processing methods in natural language processing for extracting features from text: (1) N-grams features, and (2) Word embeddings.
