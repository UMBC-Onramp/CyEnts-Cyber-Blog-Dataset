FireEye Mandiant has been investigating compromised Oracle Solaris machines in customer environments.
During our investigations, we discovered an exploit tool on a customer’s system and analyzed it to see how it was attacking their Solaris environment.
The FLARE team’s Offensive Task Force analyzed the exploit to determine how it worked, reproduced the vulnerability on different versions of Solaris, and then reported it to Oracle.
In this blog post we present a description of the vulnerability, offer a quick way to test whether a system may be vulnerable, and suggest mitigations and workarounds.
 Mandiant experts from the FLARE team will provide more information on this vulnerability and how it was used by UNC1945 during a Nov. 12 webinar.
Register today and start preparing questions, because we will be fielding them from the audience at the end of the session.
