This seems particularly relevant when (at the time of writing) 3,865,098 instances of port 3389 are showing as open on Shodan.
Prior to this, RDP was already on our radar.
Last July, McAfee ATR did a deep dive on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) marketplaces and described the sheer ease with which cybercriminals can obtain access to a large variety of computer systems, some of which are very sensitive.
One of the methods of RDP misuse that we discussed was how it could aid deploying a targeted ransomware campaign.
At that time one of the most prolific targeted ransomware groups was SamSam.
To gain an initial foothold on its victims’ networks, SamSam would often rely on weakly protected RDP access.
From its RDP launchpad, it would proceed to move laterally through a victim’s network, successfully exploiting and discovering additional weaknesses, for instance in a company’s Active Directory (AD).
In November 2018, the FBI and the Justice department indicted two Iranian men for developing and spreading the SamSam ransomware extorting hospitals, municipalities and public institutions, causing over $30 million in losses.
Unfortunately, this did not stop other cybercriminals from using similar tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).
The sheer number of vulnerable systems in the wild make it a “target” rich environment for cybercriminals.
In the beginning of 2019 we dedicated several blogs to the Ryuk ransomware family that has been using RDP as an initial entry vector.
