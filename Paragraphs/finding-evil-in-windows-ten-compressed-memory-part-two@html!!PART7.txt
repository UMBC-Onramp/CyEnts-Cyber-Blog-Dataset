We use the PageFile structure’s newly introduced VirtualStorePagefile field to confirm if the PageFile represents a virtual store.
Figure 4:
Locating nt!MmPagingFile in WinDbg and dumping system’s nt!_MMPAGING_FILE structures Having confirmed that the marker page is in the virtual store, the next step is to calculate the Store Manager Page Key ( SM_PAGE_KEY ), as it serves as a pseudo-handle to locate the decompressed page.
Our white paper details the process used to calculate the SM_PAGE_KEY , which turns out to be 0x201a3061 for this example.
Note, that we will not use the PTE’s swizzle bit in the page key calculations, since the OS build is below 1803.
To begin page retrieval, the pointer to the Store Manager’s global structure or nt!SmGlobals needs to be located.
