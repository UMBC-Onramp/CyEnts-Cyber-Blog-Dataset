In all other cases, the malware starts with the well-known class GUIDs of the PlaySoundService and MsCtfMonitor classes and attempts to find which of them has the TreatAs registry key under their definition.
Once the TreatAs key is found, its default registry value points to the registry key that has the RC4-encrypted backdoor image and the encoded RC4 key both described in the previous section of the post.
With the backdoor image loaded in memory and decrypted, the malware spawns a suspended process around msiexec.exe and inject its image into it.
The backdoor PE file exports a single function that is used to lay down its own image in memory and execute its DllMain entry point.
The export function allocates the needed memory, relocates the image, if needed, resolves the imports and finally executes the backdoorâ€™s DllMain function.
At this point the backdoor is running inside the hijacked msiexec.exe and the instance inside the PowerShell process terminates itself.
Executing as Injected in the msiexec.exe Process Overview
The DOUBLEBACK backdoor executes its main functionality while injected in a dedicated msiexec.exe process (provided BitDefender AV is not found running on the system).
