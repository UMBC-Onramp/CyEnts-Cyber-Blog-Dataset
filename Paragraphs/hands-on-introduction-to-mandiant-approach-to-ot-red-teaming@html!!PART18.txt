For this example, we were tasked with modeling a case where the attacker was attempting to create a condition that had a high likelihood of causing physical damage and disruption of operations (see Figure 3).
In this scenario, the attacker attempted to achieve this by lowering the water level in a boiler drum below the safe threshold while not tripping the burner management system or other safety mechanisms.
If successful, this would result in rapid and extreme overheating in the boiler.
Opening the feedwater valve under such conditions could result in a catastrophic explosion.
