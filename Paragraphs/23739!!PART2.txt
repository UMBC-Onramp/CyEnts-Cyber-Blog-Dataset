For this reason, the Apache Foundation recommends all developers to update the library to version 2.15.0, and if this is not possible, use one of the methods described on the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page .
Why CVE-2021-44228 is so dangerous CVE-2021-44228, also named Log4Shell or LogJam, is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) class vulnerability.
If attackers manage to exploit it on one of the servers, they gain the ability to execute arbitrary code and potentially take full control of the system.
What makes CVE-2021-44228 especially dangerous is the ease of exploitation: even an inexperienced hacker can successfully execute an attack using this vulnerability.
According to the researchers, attackers only need to force the application to write just one string to the log, and after that they are able to upload their own code into the application due to the message lookup substitution function.
Working Proofs of Concept (PoC) for the attacks via CVE-2021-44228 are already available on the Internet.
Therefore, itâ€™s not surprising that cybersecurity companies are already registering massive network scans for vulnerable applications as well as attacks on honeypots.
This vulnerability was discovered by Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba Cloud Security Team.
