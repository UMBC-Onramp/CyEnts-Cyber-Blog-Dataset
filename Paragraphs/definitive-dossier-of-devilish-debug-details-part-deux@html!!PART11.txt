This makes intuitive sense given the more collaborative environment a “legitimate” software development process might require.
There are, of course, many exceptions and this is what makes the problem tricky.
Another strong signal we found, at least in our dataset, is that when the word “Desktop” was in a non-English language and particularly in a different alphabet, the likelihood of that PDB path being tied to a malicious file was very high (Figure 2).
While potentially useful, this can be indicative of geographical bias in our dataset, and further research would need to be done to see if this type of signature would generalize.
