Welcome to Y2K
The dawn of the new millennium saw more and more people connected globally.
And at the same time, there was a dramatic increase in the volume of attacks due to the increased number of potential victims, driven by the hyper-growth of the internet.
Besides the growth of new high-tech companies (the dotcom bubble), 1999 was a year mired in fear about the “Y2K” bug.
While not a virus, Y2K caused widespread panic because there was a fear that legacy computers would stop operating after December 31, 1999, due to a design flaw in the BIOS, which controls the computer's motherboard.
When rebooted on January 1, 2000, the operating system would believe it was January 1, 1900, disrupting everything from gas pumps and elevators to trading floors and power plants.
Ultimately, this design flaw proved to be less of a problem than thought, and most organizations and individuals escaped unscathed.
