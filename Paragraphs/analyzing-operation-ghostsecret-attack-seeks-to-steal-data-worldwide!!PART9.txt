Control Servers
Further investigation into the control server infrastructure reveals the SSL certificate d0cb9b2d4809575e1bc1f4657e0eb56f307c7a76, which is tied to the control server 203.131.222.83, used by the February 2018 implant.
This server resides at Thammasat University in Bangkok, Thailand.
The same entity hosted the control server for the Sony Pictures implants.
This SSL certificate has been used in Hidden Cobra operations since the Sony Pictures attack.
Analyzing this certificate reveals additional control servers using the same PolarSSL certificate.
Further analysis of McAfee telemetry data reveals several IP addresses that are active, two within the same network block as the 2018 Destover-like implant.
