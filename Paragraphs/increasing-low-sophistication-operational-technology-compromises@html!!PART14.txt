Mandiant Threat Intelligence offers subscription content, custom analysis, and black box assessments that help organizations identify internet-exposed assets and information.
Maintain situational awareness on threat actors’ interest in cyber physical systems and the development of OT exploits , with particular interest in attention driven to your organization, third party providers, or original equipment manufacturers (OEM).
Configure HMIs and other control system assets to enforce acceptable input ranges and prohibit hazardous variable states.
Similar to web application security, automation programmers should treat all operator input as potentially malicious and gain security assurances by validating that the operator input is within acceptable thresholds.
