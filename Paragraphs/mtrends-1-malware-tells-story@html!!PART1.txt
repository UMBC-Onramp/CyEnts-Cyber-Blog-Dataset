When I joined Mandiant earlier this year, I was given the opportunity to help write our annual M-Trends report .
This is the third year Mandiant has published the report, which is a summary of the trends we've observed in our investigations over the last twelve months.
I remember reading Mandiant's first M-Trends report when it came out in 2010 and recall being surprised that Mandiant didn't pull any punches.
