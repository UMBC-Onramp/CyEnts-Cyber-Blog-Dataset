Fast and Relentless APT41 quickly identifies and compromises intermediary systems that provide access to otherwise segmented parts of an organizationâ€™s network.
In one case, the group compromised hundreds of systems across multiple network segments and several geographic regions in as little as two weeks.
The group is also highly agile and persistent, responding quickly to changes in victim environments and incident responder activity.
Hours after a victimized organization made changes to thwart APT41, for example, the group compiled a new version of a backdoor using a freshly registered command-and-control domain and compromised several systems across multiple geographic regions.
In a different instance, APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to multiple HR employees three days after an intrusion had been remediated and systems were brought back online.
