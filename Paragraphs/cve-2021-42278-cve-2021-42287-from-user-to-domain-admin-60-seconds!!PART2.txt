In this post, we will describe how the exploitation of these vulnerabilities works and show how the attack is mitigated by FortiEDR.
CVE-2021-42278 - Invalid Computer Account Name Computer account names in Active Directory environments should always end with “$”, however, this is not enforced correctly.
The computer account name attribute is “sAMAccountName”.
It is possible to see and edit the this attribute manually using the ADSIEdit Tool, as can be seen in Figure 1.
