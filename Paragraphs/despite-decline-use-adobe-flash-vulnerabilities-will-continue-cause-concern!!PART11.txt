Coupling the increasing difficulty of finding problems against the increase in effectiveness of a software security program, we find a distribution like what we have seen with Flash CVE reporting from 2015 through 2017.
Until 2015, attackers exploited relatively easy-to-find cross-site scripting errors, but these largely disappeared after 2014.
Suddenly, in 2015, there is a huge jump in the discovery of difficult-to-uncover memory issues and code execution opportunities.
The leap in the CVE numbers reflects more technically challenging issues surfacing just as Adobeâ€™s software strategy was making its shift.
The new strategy had not had time to be fully effective by 2015.
Plus, Flash, like all complex software, carries a large amount of legacy code.
