If SolarWinds infrastructure is not isolated, consider taking the following steps: Restrict scope of connectivity to endpoints from SolarWinds servers, especially those that would be considered Tier 0 / crown jewel assets Restrict the scope of accounts that have local administrator privileged on SolarWinds servers.
Block Internet egress from servers or other endpoints with SolarWinds software.
Consider (at a minimum) changing passwords for accounts that have access to SolarWinds servers / infrastructure.
