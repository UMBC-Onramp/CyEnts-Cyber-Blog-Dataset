FireEye Labs recently detected a limited APT campaign exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and a brand-new one in Microsoft Windows.
Using the Dynamic Threat Intelligence Cloud (DTI) , FireEye researchers detected a pattern of attacks beginning on April 13 th , 2015.
Adobe independently patched the vulnerability (CVE-2015-3043) in APSB15-06 .
Through correlation of technical indicators and command and control infrastructure, FireEye assess that APT28 is probably responsible for this activity.
Microsoft is aware of the outstanding local privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows (CVE-2015-1701).
While there is not yet a patch available for the Windows vulnerability, updating Adobe Flash to the latest version will render this in-the-wild exploit innocuous.
