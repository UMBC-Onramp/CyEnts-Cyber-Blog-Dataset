In early 2019, FireEye Threat Intelligence identified a spear phishing email targeting government entities in Ukraine.
 
The spear phishing email included a malicious LNK file with PowerShell script to download the second-stage payload from the command and control (C&C) server.
The email was received by military departments in Ukraine and included lure content related to the sale of demining machines.
This latest activity is a continuation of spear phishing that targeted the Ukrainian Government as early as 2014.
The email is linked to activity that previously targeted the Ukrainian Government with RATVERMIN.
 Infrastructure analysis indicates the actors behind the intrusion activity may be associated with the so-called Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).
