As a scientific work, Spook.js is set to alter the software landscape through the introduction of new recommendations for website security (for example, the authors propose moving authorization pages to a separate domain name).
Subsequent studies may find ways to make attacks a little easier, but most likely they will lead to more rounds of security enhancements.
Even if Spectre-type vulnerabilities can be exploited en masse, the protection means will be the same as for any malware.
Security vendors will simply add the new types of attacks to the list of those to be monitored and blocked before execution.
Itâ€™s also possible that one day researchers will stumble upon a feature of Spectre-like vulnerabilities that necessitates a major reworking of the entire modern IT ecosystem.
