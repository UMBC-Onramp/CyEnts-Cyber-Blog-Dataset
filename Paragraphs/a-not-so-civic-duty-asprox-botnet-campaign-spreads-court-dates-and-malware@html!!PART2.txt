These changes have made it difficult for anti-virus, IPS, firewalls and file-based sandboxes to keep up with the malware and effectively protect endpoints from infection.
Worse, if past is prologue, we can expect other malicious, mass-targeting email operators to adopt this approach to bypass traditional defenses.
This blog will cover the trends of the campaign, as well as provide a short technical analysis of the payload.
Campaign Details Figure 1: Attack Architecture
The campaign first appeared in late December of 2013 and has since been seen in fairly cyclical patterns each month.
It appears that the threat actors behind this campaign are fairly responsive to published blogs and reports surrounding their malware techniques, tweaking their malware accordingly to continuously try and evade detection with success.
In late 2013, malware labeled as Kuluoz, the specific spam component of the Asprox botnet, was discovered to be the main payload of what would become the first malicious email campaign.
