Figure 10: Exploiting chown vulnerability to gain shell as user root
And there we have it: a remote connection as root, by abusing two separate vulnerabilities.
While not explored in this series, another viable avenue of attack would be to explore potential vulnerabilities in the web server listening on TCP ports 80 and 443; however, this was not an approach that we took.
Conclusion We covered a wide variety of topics in this two-part series, including: Physical device inspection Identifying and exploring physical debugging interfaces (UART) Chip-off techniques to remove the NAND storage Binary analysis of the filesystems and bootloader configurations Power glitch attacks against the U-Boot bootloader Linux user space privilege escalation We hope that readers were able to learn from our experiences with the X2e and will be inspired to use these techniques in their own analysis.
Finally, Mandiant would like to thank both Tesla/SolarCity and Digi International for their efforts to remediate these vulnerabilities and for their cooperation with releasing this blog series.
