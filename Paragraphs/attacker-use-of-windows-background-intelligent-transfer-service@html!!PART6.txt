The QMGR Database BITS jobs and associated state information are stored in local “queue manager” (QMGR) database files in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Microsoft\\Network\\Downloader directory.
The database is stored to files named qmgr0.dat and qmgr1.dat.
The two-file scheme appears to be used for back up and synchronization purposes.
The second file largely contains duplicate job and file information, though some unique or older entries can be found in the file.
Windows 10 Changes The Background Intelligent Transfer Service has largely remained unchanged since its introduction.
However, Windows 10 introduced significant changes to the service, including an all new database format.
On Windows 10 the QMGR database is stored using the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) format.
ESE databases have been used in many other Microsoft products including Exchange, Active Directory, and Internet Explorer.
Windows 10 stores the QMGR database in a single file called qmgr.db .
Separate transaction log files are maintained in the same directory.
