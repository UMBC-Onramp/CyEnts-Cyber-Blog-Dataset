“Vital signs are integral to clinical decision making” explained Dr. Shaun Nordeck.
Bedside patient monitors and related systems are key components that provide medical professionals with the vital signs they need to make decisions; these systems are now the focal point of this research.
Exploring the attack surface Most patient monitoring systems comprise at minimum of two basic components: a bedside monitor and a central monitoring station.
These devices are wired or wirelessly networked over TCP/IP.
The central monitoring station collects vitals from multiple bedside monitors so that a single medical professional can observe multiple patients.
