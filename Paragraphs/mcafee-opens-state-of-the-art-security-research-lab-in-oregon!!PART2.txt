Although we have smaller labs in other locations, the new McAfee Advanced Threat Research Lab was created to serve two purposes.
First, it gives our talented researchers an appropriate work space with access to high-end hardware and electronics for discovery, analysis, automation, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in software, firmware, and hardware.
Second, the lab will serve as a demo facility, where the Advanced Threat Research team can showcase current research and live demos to customers or potential customers, law enforcement partners, academia, and even vendors.
