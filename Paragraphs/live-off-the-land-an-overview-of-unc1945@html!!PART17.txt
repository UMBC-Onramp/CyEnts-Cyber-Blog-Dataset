Associated Tools and Malware Families EVILSUN is a remote exploitation tool that gains access to Solaris 10 and 11 systems of SPARC or i386 architecture using a vulnerability (CVE-2020-14871) exposed by SSH keyboard-interactive authentication.
The remote exploitation tool makes SSH connections to hosts passed on the command line.
The default port is the normal SSH port (22), but this may be overridden.
EVILSUN passes the banner string SSH-2.0-Sun_SSH_1.1.3 over the connection in clear text as part of handshaking.
