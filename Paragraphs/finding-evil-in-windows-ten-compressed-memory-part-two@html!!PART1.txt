Introduction This blog post is the second in a three-part series covering our Windows 10 memory forensics research and it coincides with our BlackHat USA 2019 presentation.
In Part One of the series , we covered the integration of the research in both Volatily and Rekall memory forensics tools.
We demonstrated that forensic artifacts (including reflectively loaded malware) could remain undiscovered without the FLARE research integration on Windows 10 (available on GitHub at win10_volatility and win10_rekall ).
In this post, we demonstrate how to retrieve a compressed page using the structures and algorithms described in our white paper .
