Figure 10: Complex system calls go through Wow64SystemServiceEx We’ll look at this routine in a moment as it’s the meat of this blog post, but for now let’s finish this call trace.
Once Wow64SystemServiceEx returns from doing the system call the return value in eax is moved into the WOW64_CONTEXT structure and then the 32-bit register states are restored.
There’s two paths for this, a common case and a case that appears to exist only to be used by NtContinue and other WOW64 internals.
A flag at the start of the WOW64_CPURESERVED structure retrieved from the TLS slot is checked, and controls which restore path to follow as shown in Figure 11.
Figure 11: CPU state is restored once the system call is done; there’s a simple path and a complex one handling XMM registers The simpler case will build a jmp that uses the segment selector 0x23 to transition back to 32-bit mode after restoring all the saved registers in the WOW64_CONTEXT .
The more complex case will additionally restore some segments, xmm values, and the saved registers in the WOW64_CONTEXT structure and then will do an iret to transition back.
