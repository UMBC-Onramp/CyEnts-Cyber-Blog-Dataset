Be careful with messages E-mail attachments and infected websites are the most common hiding places for ransomware Trojans, so treat all unexpected e-mails and messages as potential sources of danger.
What makes a message suspicious, though?

Make sure you know the sender.
Treat content, attachments and links in e-mails from strangers with the utmost skepticism.
This applies to messages in messaging apps, social networks, and forums as well.
If you have any concerns , consign the message to your spam folder, especially if it promises unexpected payouts.
To encounter such messages less often, configure spam filtering and mail traffic scanning in your security solution.
If you receive a suspicious link or file that you weren’t expecting from someone you do know, contact them by phone or in another format; their account or mailbox may have been compromised.
