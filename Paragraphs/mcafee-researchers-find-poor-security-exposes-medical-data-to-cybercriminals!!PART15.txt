We investigated relatively few open-source vendors, but it begs the question: What more could we have found if we had access to professional hardware and software?
Default accounts, cross-site scripting, or vulnerabilities in the web server could lead to access to the systems.
Our research demonstrates that once inside the systems, the data and pictures can be permanently altered.
In May 2017, one report claimed that through artificial intelligence pictures could be studied to determine how long a person will live.
What if criminals could obtain that information and use it for extortion?
We understand the need for quickly sharing medical data for diagnosis and treatment and for storing medical images.
We advise health care organizations to be careful when sharing images on open directories for research purposes and to at least scrape the PII data from the images.
For organizations using a PACS, ask your vendor about its security features.
Employ a proper network design in which the sharing systems are properly secured.
Think not only about internal security but also about the use of VPNs and two-factor authentication when connecting with external systems.
