The presence of a specific registry key on the system HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-
Qt The malware appends an indicator (flag) specifying whether the above registry key was found in the userâ€™s registry: This key is checked again as part of the command and control communication and is sent as a duplicate value to the command and control in the HTTP POST request as well (explained in the below).
Malware checking for the presence of the registry key Exfiltration Preparation In preparation of the exfiltration of information collected from the endpoint, the malware performs the following activities: Encode the collected information using a simple byte based XOR operation using the byte key: 0x34.
Base64 encode (standard) the XORed data.
Again, check for the presence of the Registry Key: HKCU\\Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt Command and Control Server Communication
Once the malware has performed all these activities it sends an HTTP POST request to the CnC server: www[dot]worker.co.kr for md5 BDAEDB14723C6C8A4688CC8FC1CFE668 www[dot]palgong-cc.co.kr for md5 D4C93B85FFE88DDD552860B148831026
In the format: HTTP POST to www[dot]worker.co.kr /board2004/Upload/files/main.asp?idx=%d&no=%s&mode=%s OR HTTP POST to www[dot]palgong-cc.co.kr /html/course/course05.asp?idx=%d&no=%s&mode=%s where idx= 20 (14h) if the Registry key does not exist; 24 (18h) if the key exists.
