Conceptually, word embeddings may help a classifier use these embeddings to implicitly associate relationships such as: device + infected = zombie where an entity called device has a mechanism applied called infected (malicious software infecting it) then it becomes a zombie .
To address issues where social media tweets differ linguistically from natural language, we leverage previous research and software from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community.
This addresses specific nuances like less consistent capitalization, and stemming to account for a variety of special characters like ‘@’ and ‘#’.
