In addition to these two vulnerabilities patched on iOS 8.4, we also disclose the detail of another untrusted code injection attack by replacing the VPN Plugin, the Plugin Masque Attack.
We reported this vulnerability to Apple in Nov 2014, and Apple fixed the vulnerability on iOS 8.1.3 when Apple patched the original Masque Attack (App Masque)
[6, 11].
However, this exploit is even more severe than the original Masque Attack.
The malicious code can be injected to the neagent process and can perform privileged operations, such as monitoring all VPN traffic, without the userâ€™s awareness.
