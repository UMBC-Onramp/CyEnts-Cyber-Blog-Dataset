However, in 2019 FIN11’s targeting expanded to include a diverse set of sectors and geographic regions.
At this point, it would be difficult to name a client that FIN11 hasn’t targeted.
Mandiant has also responded to numerous FIN11 intrusions, but we’ve only observed the group successfully monetize access in few instances.
This could suggest that the actors cast a wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further exploit based on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security posture.
Recently, FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish exfiltrated data to pressure victims into paying ransom demands.
The group’s shifting monetization methods—from point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware in 2019, and hybrid extortion in 2020—is part of a larger trend in which criminal actors have increasingly focused on post-compromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion.
Notably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security researchers call TA505 , but we do not attribute TA505’s early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names interchangeably.
