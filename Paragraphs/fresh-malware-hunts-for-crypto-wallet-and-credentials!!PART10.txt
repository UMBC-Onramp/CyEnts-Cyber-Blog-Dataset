This information will be sent to the attacker along with other stolen data.
It then sets %AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Templates as its home folder, where it puts some of its temporary files, such as extracted files, collected browser profiles, and collected crypto wallet data.
Collecting Crypto Wallet Data
This malware focuses on collecting profiles of crypto wallets (if installed) from the infected device.
It has ten predefined crypto wallet software instances in the malware with a dynamically combined default profile folder path, as shown at the bottom of Figure 3.2.
This crypto wallet software includes: Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Jaxx Liberty, Exodus, Ethereum, Electrum, Atomic, Guarda, and Coinomi.
Once a crypto wallet is detected, it copies the entire folder containing the wallet’s profile data (including sub-folders and files—like the path listed in Figure 3.2) to its home folder (at “%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Templates”).
