Goals and Objectives Methodologies that UNC2452 and other threat actors have used to move laterally from on-premises networks to the Microsoft 365 cloud have been detailed in our white paper, Remediation and Hardening Strategies for Microsoft 365 to Defend Against UNC2452 .
The paper also discusses how organizations can proactively harden their environments and remediate environments where similar techniques have been observed.
Mandiant is releasing an auditing script, Azure AD Investigator , through its GitHub repository that organizations can use to check their Microsoft 365 tenants for indicators of some of the techniques used by UNC2452.
The script will alert administrators and security practitioners to artifacts that may require further review to determine if they are truly malicious or part of legitimate activity.
Many of the attacker techniques detailed in the white paper are dual-use in natureâ€”they can be used by threat actors but also by legitimate tools.
Therefore, a detailed review for specific configuration parameters may be warranted, including correlating and verifying that configurations are aligned with authorized and expected activities.
