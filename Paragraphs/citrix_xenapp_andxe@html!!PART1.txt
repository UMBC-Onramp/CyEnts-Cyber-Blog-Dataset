A Joint Whitepaper from Mandiant and Citrix Throughout the course of Mandiantâ€™s Red Team and Incident Response engagements, we frequently identify a wide array of misconfigured technology solutions, including Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop.
We often see attackers leveraging stolen credentials from third parties, accessing Citrix solutions, breaking out of published applications, accessing the underlying operating systems, and moving laterally to further compromise the environment.
Our experience shows that attackers are increasingly using Citrix solutions to remotely access victim environments post-compromise, instead of using traditional backdoors, remote access tools, or other types of malware.
