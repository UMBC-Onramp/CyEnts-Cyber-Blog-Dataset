2016–2017: Petya, NotPetya, and WannaCry
In April 2016, new malware called Petya reared its head.
Whereas previous cryptors had left operating systems intact to allow victims to pay the ransom, Petya completely bricked infected machines; it targeted the MFT (Master File Table) — a database that stores the entire structure of files and folders on the hard drive.
As destructive as it was, Petya’s penetration and distribution mechanism was rough.
To activate it, the victim had to manually download and run an executable file, which made infection less likely.
In fact, it might not have made much of a mark if not for another ransomware — the aptly named WannaCry .
In May 2017, WannaCry infected more than 500,000 devices worldwide, causing $4 billion of damage.
How did it do that?
