To answer these questions we needed to take one of two paths.
We could virtualize the Wemo firmware or binary to continue testing; or if we could determine the root password on the UART interface, there is a chance we could debug on the device itself.
Generally, virtualizing firmware is not simple and can sometimes lead to inaccurate test results.
It is better to debug on the device.
With all the information we found during reconnaissance, it seemed promising that we could bypass the root password.
