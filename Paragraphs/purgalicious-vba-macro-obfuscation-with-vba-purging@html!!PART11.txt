Searching with this logic on VirusTotal reveals a large number of\nmalicious documents, meaning this is very prevalent in the wild and in\nuse by attackers.
This rule should identify most publicly documented\nexamples of VBA purging, such as 9fd864e578d8bb985cf71a24089f5e2f ( HornetSecurity ).\nHowever, it may also identify some false positives.
As previously\nidentified by Didier\nStevens , some public libraries such as EPPlus may generate benign\ndocuments without PerformanceCache data and\nappear to be purged.
Another important limitation of this rule is that the _VBA_PROJECT stream data doesn’t have to be\ncompletely removed.
So while the stream size is 7 in all publicly\ndocumented examples of this technique
, it doesn’t have to be exactly 7.
