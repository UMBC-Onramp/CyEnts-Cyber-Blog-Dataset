The Syrian Malware Team primarily uses another version of BlackWorm called the Dark Edition (v2.1).
BlackWorm v2.1 was released on a prolific underground forum where information and code is often shared, traded and sold.
BlackWorm v2.1 has the same abilities as the original version and additional functionality, including bypassing UAC, disabling host firewalls and spreading over network shares.
Unlike its predecessor, it also allows for granular control of the features available within the RAT.
