In our continuing mission to equip security professionals against today’s advanced cyber threats, FireEye has published a free report, “ Brewing Up Trouble: Analyzing Four Widely Exploited Java Vulnerabilities .”
The report outlines four commonly exploited Java vulnerabilities and maps out the step-by-step infection flow of exploits kits that leverage them.
Download the paper to learn more about these vulnerabilities: CVE-2013-2471 , which allows attackers to override Java’s getNumDataElements() method, leading to memory corruption.
CVE-2013-2465 ,  which involves insufficient bounds checks in the storeImageArray() function.
This vulnerability is used by White Lotus and other exploit kits.
CVE-2012-4681 ,  which allows attackers to bypass security checks using the findMethod () function.
CVE-2013-2423 , which  arises due to insufficient validation in the findStaticSetter () method, leading to Java type confusion.
