While I could have tried to feed my patches in IDA Pro back to vivisect or to create a modified binary, I instead created a new IDAPython script that does not depend on vivisect.
Thus, circumventing the mentioned shortcomings.
It uses IDA Pro’s program analysis and Unicorn’s emulation engine.
The easy integration of these two tools is powered by flare-emu .
Using IDA Pro instead of vivisect resolves multiple limitations of our previous implementations.
