Let us take a deep technical dive into the MassLogger credential stealer and the .NET runtime.
Triage MassLogger is a .NET credential stealer.
It starts with a launcher ( 6b975fd7e3eb0d30b6dbe71b8004b06de6bba4d0870e165de4bde7ab82154871 ) that uses simple anti-debugging techniques which can be easily bypassed when identified.
This first stage loader eventually XOR-decrypts the second stage assembly which then decrypts, loads and executes the final MassLogger payload ( bc07c3090befb5e94624ca4a49ee88b3265a3d1d288f79588be7bb356a0f9fae ) named Bin-123.exe .
The final payload can be easily extracted and executed independently.
Therefore, we will focus exclusively on this final payload where the main anti analysis technique is used.
Basic static analysis doesn’t reveal anything too exciting.
We notice some interesting strings, but they are not enough to give us any hints about the malware’s capabilities.
