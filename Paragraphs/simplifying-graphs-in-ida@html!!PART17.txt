Example SimplifyGraph.cfg contents ``` \"MINIMUM_SUBGRAPH_NODE_COUNT\"=5 \"MAXIMUM_SUBGRAPH_NODE_PERCENTAGE\"=75 \"SUBGRAPH_HIGHLIGHT_COLOR\"=0x00aa1111 ``` Prior work: I came across semi-related work while working on this: GraphSlick from the 2014 Hex-Rays contest .
Â That plug-in had different goals to automatically identifying (nearly) identical inline functions via CFG and basic block analysis, and patching the program to force mock function calls to the explicit function.
It had a separate viewer to present information to the user.
SimplifyGraph is focused on automating tasks when doing manual reverse engineering (group creation) to reduce the complexity of disassembly in graph mode.
