Once decrypted, the Domain Controller examines the Authenticator and verifies the contents.
If this operation succeeds, the user is considered authenticated by the Domain Controller and the requested service ticket is created.
The Domain Controller generates the service ticket requested for cifs/SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP.
The data within the service ticket is also considered sensitive.
If a user could manipulate the service ticket data, they could impersonate any user on the domain to the service as performed in the Silver Ticket attack.
To prevent this from easily happening, the Domain Controller encrypts the service ticket with the Kerberos key of the computer the user is authenticating to.
All domain-joined computers in Active Directory possess a randomly generated computer account credential that both the computer and Domain Controller are aware of.
The Domain Controller also generates a second session key specific to the service ticket and places a copy in both the encrypted service ticket and a new Authenticator structure.
