We discovered the following Clop ransomware samples which were signed with a certificate: This malware is prepared to avoid running under certain conditions, for example in the first version it requests to be installed as a service; if that will not succeed, it will terminate itself.
The malware’s first action is to compare the keyboard of the victim computer using the function “GetKeyboardLayout”  against the hardcoded values.
This function returns the user keyboard input layout at the moment the malware calls the function.
