Windows uses a technology called Distributed Key Management (DKM) to store the secret value used to derive the symmetric key in an Active Directory container.
The AD FS service account can read the attributes of this container, derive the symmetric key, and then decrypt the Token Signing Certificate.
AD FS Replication AD FS also supports a farm configuration for high availability and load balancing in larger enterprise networks.
The individual AD FS servers in a farm can be configured to use unique Token Signing Certificates; however, the default is to have the servers share the same Token Signing Certificate.
