Consequently, we expect that additional actors will continue to develop this capability.
The following are some real-world examples of cryptojacking worms: In May 2017, Proofpoint reported a large campaign distributing mining malware \"Adylkuzz.\" This cryptocurrency miner was observed leveraging the EternalBlue exploit to rapidly spread itself over corporate LANs and wireless networks.
This activity included the use of the DoublePulsar backdoor to download Adylkuzz.
Adylkuzz infections create botnets of Windows computers that focus on mining Monero.
Security researchers with Sensors identified a Monero miner worm, dubbed \"Rarogminer,\" in April 2018 that would copy itself to removable drives each time a user inserted a flash drive or external HDD.
In January 2018, researchers at F5 discovered a new Monero cryptomining botnet that targets Linux machines.
PyCryptoMiner is based on Python script and spreads via the SSH protocol.
The bot can also use Pastebin for its command and control (C2) infrastructure.
