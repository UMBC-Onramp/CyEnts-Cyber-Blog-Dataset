The request is made using the service's Service Principal Name (“SPN”).
In this case, the SPN would be cifs/SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP.
Windows builds the service ticket request in a TGS-REQ packet.
Within the TGS-REQ packet, Windows places a copy of the TGT previously obtained from the Domain Controller.
This time, the Authenticator is encrypted with the TGT session key previously obtained from the domain controller.
An example TGS-REQ packet is shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7: TGS-REQ
Once the Domain Controller receives the TGS-REQ packet, it extracts the TGT from the request and decrypts it with the krbtgt Kerberos key.
The Domain Controller verifies that the TGT is valid and extracts the session key field from the TGT.
The Domain Controller then attempts to decrypt the Authenticator in the TGS-REQ packet with the session key.
