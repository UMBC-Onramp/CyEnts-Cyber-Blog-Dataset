With the Bitcoin surge, malware developers and underground markets found themselves in need of more stability, prompting a switch to other currencies and a resurgence of old techniques.
It is far easier to mine small currencies because the hash rate is generally more manageable and hardware requirements can be more accessible depending on the network design.
Monero, for example, is ASIC resistant, meaning that while mining specialized hardware does not have an overwhelming advantage to nonspecialized hardware.
This allows the average computer to be more effective at the task.
Due to this advantage, Monero is actively mined in mass by criminals using web-based miners on the machines of unsuspecting visitors.
This intrusion is known as cryptojacking, which works by hijacking the browser session to use system resources.
A quick look at recent examples of cryptojacking throws light on this issue.
Starting mid-2017, there have been a slew of instances in which major websites have found themselves compromised and unwittingly hosting the code, turning their users into mining bots.
The public Wi-Fi at a Starbucks outlet was found to hijack browsers to mine Monero.
Even streaming services such as YouTube have been affected through infected ads .
