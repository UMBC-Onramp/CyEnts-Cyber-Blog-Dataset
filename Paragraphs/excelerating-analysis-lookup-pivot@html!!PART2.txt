In this post, we will cover two additional versatile features of Excel: LOOKUP functions and PivotTables.
For this scenario, we will use a dataset of logon events for an example Microsoft Office 365 (O365) instance to demonstrate how an analyst can enrich information in the dataset.
Then we will demonstrate some examples of how to use PivotTables to summarize information and highlight anomalies in the data quickly.
Our data contains the following columns: Description – Event description User – User’s name User Principle Name – email address App – such as Office 365, Sharepoint, etc.
