The Wemo listens on Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) ports TCP 49152 and 49153.
The manuals, disassembly images, and the general-purpose programming language (GPL) were all online; they provided information on CPU architecture, the operating system, and applications.
We turned to the hardware and disassembled the device.
We identified chips on the main board, found headers for communicating with the device, and pulled the memory off flash.
Our online research provided datasheets for each of the chips on the board.
We found universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) pads on the board and confirmed them with the documentation.
We soldered wires to these headers to discover if they were actively transmitting.
To test communication with the device, we used an Exodus XI Breakout board, shown below:
