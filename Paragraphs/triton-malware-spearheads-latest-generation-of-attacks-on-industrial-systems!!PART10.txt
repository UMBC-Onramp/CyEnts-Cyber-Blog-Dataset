Because the attack was discovered early, it is possible that the attackers did not have time to launch the final stage.
How to detect an unusual network connection Nozomi Networks has created a script that simulates a Triconex safety controller.
We modified this script with a Raspberry Pi to create a cheap detector tool.
This inexpensive tool can be easily installed on an ICS network.
If an illegitimate connection occurs, the device alerts with a blinking LED and siren.
It also displays the IP address of the connection for further investigation.
