Escad variant we analyzed.
Thus the new implant is likely a derivative of components of Destover.
We determined that the implant is not a direct copy of well-known previous samples of Destover; rather, Hidden Cobra created a new hybrid variant using functionality present in earlier versions.

2015
Destover variant (7fe373376e0357624a1d21cd803ce62aa86738b6).
The February implant fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c was obtained from an unknown submitter in the United States on February 14, two days after it was compiled.
This Korean-language file used the control server IP address 203.131.222.83.
The implant is nearly identical to an unknown 2017 sample (8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) except that the control server addresses are different.
The 2017 sample used address 14.140.116.172.
Both implants specifically use FakeTLS with PolarSSL, which we saw in previous Hidden Cobra implants.
PolarSSL libraries have appeared in implants since the Sony Pictures incident and were used exclusively in the implant Backdoor.
Destover.
This implant incorporated a custom control server protocol that sends traffic over port 443.
The implementation does not format the packets in standard SSL, but rather in a custom format and transmitted over SSLâ€”hence, FakeTLS.
The control server traffic when compared to Backdoor.
Escad is nearly identical.
