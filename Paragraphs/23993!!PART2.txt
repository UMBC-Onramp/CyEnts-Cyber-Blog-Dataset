Source Cities: Skylines is a competitor and in some ways a successor to the famous SimCity series from the 1990s and 2000s, whose history (so far) ended with a failed release in 2013.
Cities: Skylines was released in 2015 â€” quite a long time ago by standards of the ever-changing online world, but fans are unlikely to be scared by this.
Instead of releasing a new series, the creators of Cities: Skylines preferred an approach with gradual modification of the original game, releasing official expansion packs about every six months.
