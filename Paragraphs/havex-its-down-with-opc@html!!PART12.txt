Sample scan log The contents of the tmp.dat file are the results of the scan of the network devices, looking for OPC servers.
These are not the in-depth results of the OPC servers themselves, and only perform the initial scanning.
The particular Havex sample in question also enumerates OPC tags and fully interrogates the OPC servers identified within %TEMP%\\[random].tmp.dat.
The particular fields queried are: server state, tag name, type, access, and id. The contents of a sample %TEMP%\\OPCServer[random].txt can be found below: Figure 10:
Contents of OPCServer[Random].txt OPC interrogation While we don’t have a particular case study to prove the attacker’s next steps, it is likely after these files are created and saved, they will be exfiltrated to a command and control server for further processing.
