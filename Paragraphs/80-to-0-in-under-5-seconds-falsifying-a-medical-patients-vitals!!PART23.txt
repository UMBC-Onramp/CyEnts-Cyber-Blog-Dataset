a1:6e:bf, which is actually the Kali virtual machine.
Wireshark recognizes two MACs with the same IP address assigned and highlights them, showing the ARP spoof.
Next the attacker from the virtual machine at address 126.4.153.153 sends false information to the central monitoring station, still at address 126.1.1.1.
In this example, offset 0x71 has been changed to 0x78, or 120.
(The attacker could choose any value; the following demo videos use the heartbeat value 180 because it is more alarming.)
Also notice the IP address stored in the payload, which we discovered during the reconnaissance phase.
