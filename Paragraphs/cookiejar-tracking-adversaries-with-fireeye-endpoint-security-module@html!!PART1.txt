During a recent investigation at a telecommunications company led by Mandiant Managed Defense , our team was tasked with rapidly identifying systems that had been accessed by a threat actor using legitimate, but compromised domain credentials.
This sometimes-challenging task was made simple because the customer had enabled the Logon Tracker module within their FireEye Endpoint Security product.
Logon Tracker is an Endpoint Security Innovation Architecture module designed to simplify the investigation of lateral movement within Windows enterprise environments.
Logon Tracker improves the efficiency of investigating lateral movement by aggregating historical logon activity and provides a mechanism to monitor for new activity.
