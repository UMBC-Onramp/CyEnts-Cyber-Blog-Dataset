The inserted malicious logic hijacks execution just after DSAuth::RadiusAuthServer::handleResponse where the password sent to the RADIUS server is checked against a backdoor password.
If this check passes the malicious logic overwrites the retrieved packet with values indicating that it's of type 3 and that authentication was successful.
The malicious logic then rejoins the original execution flow where the packet type is checked.
If written the spoofed values force the application down the execution path of successful authentication, even though in reality authentication failed.
