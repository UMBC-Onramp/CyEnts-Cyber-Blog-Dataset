In a large enterprise setting, it is pretty common to first have a testing phase where a new image is being deployed to selected devices to ensure no conflict arises from the deployment.
This explains why the timeline from the patch release to deployment to the whole fleet may take longer than what is typical in consumer grade software.
Conclusion IoT and embedded devices tend to blend into our environment, in some cases not warranting a second thought about the security and privacy risks they pose.
In this case, with a minimal hardware investment and free software, we were able to uncover a critical bug that remained out-of-sight for more than a decade.
Avaya was prompt to fix the problem and the threat this bug poses is now mitigated, but it is important to realize this is not an isolated case and many devices across multiple industries still run legacy code more than a decade old.
From a system administration perspective, it is important to consider all these networked devices as tiny black-box computers running unmanaged code which should be isolated and monitored accordingly.
The McAfee Network Security Platform (NSP) detects this attack as “DHCP: Subnet Mask Option Length Overflow” (signature ID:
0x42601100), ensuring our customers remain protected.
Finally, for the technology enthusiasts reading this, the barrier of entry to hardware hacking has never been this low, with plenty of online resources and cheap hardware to get started.
Looking for this type of vulnerability is a great entry point to information security and will help make the embedded world a safer place.
