What can we accomplish in such a small amount of space?
One method that does not require extensive shellcode is to use a “return to libc” attack to execute the system command.
For our exploit to work out of the box, whatever command or program we run with system must be present on the device by default.
Additionally, the command string itself needs to be quite short to accommodate the limited number of bytes we have to work with.
An ideal scenario would be executing code that would allow remote shell access to the device.
Fortunately, Netcat is present on the device and this version of Netcat supports both the “-ll” flag, for persistent listening on a port for a connection, and the “-e” flag, for executing a command on connection.
