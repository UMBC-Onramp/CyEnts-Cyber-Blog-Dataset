By Philippe Laulheret on Aug 08, 2019 Avaya is the second largest VOIP solution provider ( source ) with an install base covering 90% of the Fortune 100 companies ( source ), with products targeting a wide spectrum of customers, from small business and midmarket, to large corporations.
As part of the ongoing McAfee Advanced Threat Research effort into researching critical vulnerabilities in widely deployed software and hardware, we decided to have a look at the Avaya 9600 series IP Deskphone.
We were able to find the presence of a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a piece of open source software that Avaya likely copied and modified 10 years ago, and then failed to apply subsequent security patches to.
