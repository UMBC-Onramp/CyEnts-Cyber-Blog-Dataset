This example contains an attachment, titled “W8-ENFORM.PDF.”
While not malicious, this PDF file is essentially a photocopy of the IRS W-8 form.
It is simply the W8 form from the IRS with an appended number added by the bad actors at the end of the document.
Red flags within the body of the email are the improper usage of grammar, typos, and punctuation: This scam uses social engineering verbiage to target nonresident aliens of the United States based on “official” records discovery.
However, in a weird miscue, the email contains a contradictory statement: “if you are a USA citizen and resident, this W8BEN-FORM is not meant for you…”
The email continues with instructions to reply back and to state on the attached form that the recipient is, indeed, a U.S. citizen/resident.
