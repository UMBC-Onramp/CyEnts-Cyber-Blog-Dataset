When users navigate to the compromised website, the malicious JavaScript file is downloaded, mostly from a DropBox link.
Before delivering the payload, the JavaScript sends basic system information to the server.
After receiving further commands from the server, it then executes the final JavaScript to deliver the final payload.
In our case, the JavaScript that delivers the payload is named Update.js, and it is executed from %AppData% with the help of wscript.exe.
