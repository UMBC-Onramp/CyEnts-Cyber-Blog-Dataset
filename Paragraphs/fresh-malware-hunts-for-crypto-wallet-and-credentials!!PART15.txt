Conclusion In this post I first detailed the phishing email captured by our FortiGuard Labs and its attached Word document.
Next, I demonstrated how a JS file is extracted and executed by the Macro to download the malware’s payload executable file.
I also introduced how the malware adds itself into the auto-run group and runs in the second process.
I also demonstrated the main tasks of the malware, how and what kind of sensitive information it collects from the infected device, including crypto wallet profile information and the credentials of browsers and clients, and how that collected data is sent to the attacker using the SMTP protocol.
