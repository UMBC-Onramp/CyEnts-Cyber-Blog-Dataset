At first, our team managed to identify several SQL injection vulnerabilities , but the application had a protection module that filtered the user input.
By inspecting this module, we found a weakness in the module logic that we used to bypass it.
This allowed one to exploit three SQL injection vulnerabilities.
An attacker could use this to extract sensitive information from the application database, including the administrator password hash.
Other Vulnerabilities One of the SQL injections was chained with another vulnerability — an operating system command injection vulnerability — to achieve arbitrary code execution on the appliance.
