Image parsing and rendering are basic features of any modern operating system (OS).
 Image parsing is an easily accessible attack surface, and a vulnerability that may lead to remote code execution or information disclosure in such a feature is valuable to attackers.

In part one of this series I am looking at color profiles—not an image format itself, but something which is regularly embedded within images.
