Messages larger than 10,000 bytes are sent as-is in the HTTP request body.
The fake OIP document contains the following fields: userId – a unique identifier for the victim machine sessionID – stores a new random GUID for each HTTP thread steps – an array of objects that contain the following keys: Timestamp , Index , EventType , EventName , DurationMs , Succeeded , and Message .
The JSON key EventType is hard-coded to the value Orion and the EventName is hard-coded to EventManager .
The encoded message to send to the C2 server is split up into random ranges, Base64-encoded, and stored in the Message field of the objects in the steps array.
Not all objects in the steps array contribute to the malware response.
The integer in the Timestamp field must have the 0x2 bit set to indicate the contents of the Message field are used in the malware response.
