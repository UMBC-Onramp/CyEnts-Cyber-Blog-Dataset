In this example, we are adding 4 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds.
Now we have a formula that takes the EDT timestamp and adds four hours to it to make it UTC.
Then we can replicate this formula for the rest of the table.
The end result looks like this: When we have all of our logs in the same time zone, we are ready to compile our master timeline.
Taking the UTC timestamps and the summary events we made, our new, accurate timeline looks like this: Now we can clearly see suspicious emails sent to (fictional) employees Austin and Dave.
