This is a Windows Defender executable and normally not detected by security applications.
After dropping both the executable and the DLL file, the ransomware executes MsMpEng.exe using CreateProcessW API.
Walkthrough on How This Ransomware Uses the DLL Side-Loading Technique Both mpsvc.dll and MsMpEng.exe are found within the ransomware in the resource section of the file.
To access the content of the resource section of the file, the ransomware uses FindResourceW, LoadResource, and LockResource APIs to grab the contents of the resource section.
The resource section has two main elements, “MODLIS” and “SOFTIS”.
These provide the contents for “mpsvc.dll” and “MsMpEng.exe”, respectively (Figure 7a).
The ransomware tries to access “mpsvc.dll” in the “C:\\Windows” folder.
If it fails, it will create “mpsvc.dll” in “AppData\\Local\\Temp”.
