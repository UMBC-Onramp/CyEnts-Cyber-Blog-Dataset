Once this intent is received the GlobalService is restarted with the interval parameter..
GlobalService This service contains the following variables private static final String TAG = \"GlobalService\"; private static boolean isScreenON; private int mInterval; private KeyguardManager mKeyGaurdManager; private BroadcastReceiver mPowerKeyReceiver; private Timer mSyncTimer; private TimerTask mSyncTimerTask; It goes on to check the value of the isScreenON variable.
If the screen is on and if the keyguard has been unlocked, it calls the startScreenCaptureThread() method.
The startScreenCaptureThread method sets the value of the mInterval variable to the value of interval passed to GlobalService.
It also sets the properties of the mSyncTimerTask to point to the takeScreenshot method from the ScreenCapturer class such that the thread, when invoked, will take a screenshot every ‘interval’ number of seconds.
The takeScreenshot method in the ScreenCapturer class connects to a native service using a local socket.
It connects to port 42345 on localhost.
The native service, which is listening on the same port, accepts strings on the socket.
The takeScreenshot method sends a string of the form ‘/data/local/tmp/images/screenshot_DATE.png’ to the underlying native service.
The native service checks for the string after the last trailing slash “/”, “screenshot” after the last trailing slash will cause the native service to take a screenshot by issuing the “screencap –p” method.
