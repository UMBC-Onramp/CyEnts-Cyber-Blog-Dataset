Consumers are eager to shop as much as they can on Black Friday as a lot of goods go on sale.
Free Amazon gift cards are very attractive to those who want to spend less for the holiday season.
However, be careful with what you wish for and don’t fall a victim to scams like this one.
Gaming Console Phishing Another scam FortiGuard Labs recently observed is related to gaming consoles.
With the ongoing global chip shortages, consumers are still having a hard time getting their hands on the next generation of gaming consoles, such as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S systems that debuted late last year.
FortiGuard Labs researchers recently identified a series of malicious PDFs online, with titles like, “how_much_do_xbox_one_cost_on_black_Friday.pdf” and “Walmart_black_Friday_ps5_pickup.pdf”.
The first page of each PDF uses CAPTCHA to prove the user is a human.
The Continue button on the same page does not work as expected because the user gets redirected to a web site as soon as they click the CAPTCHA checkbox.
Unfortunately for us (and fortunately for the readers), the sites the user is redirected to were no longer available at the time of the investigation.
