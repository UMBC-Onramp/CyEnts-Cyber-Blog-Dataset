Juniper Threat Labs identified several malware campaigns that rely on a pastebin-like service for its infection chain.
The domain in question is paste.nrecom.net.
The attacks usually start as a phishing email and, when a user is tricked into executing the malware, it downloads the succeeding stage of the malware from paste.nrecom.net and loads it into the memory without writing to disk.
Using a legitimate web-service for the malware infrastructure is not new, as we have seen APT group FIN6 using pastebin to host parts of the infection chain and Rocke using it for command and control.
Although using legitimate web services is not novel, this is the first time that we have seen threat actors use paste.nrecom.net.
Among the malware we have identified are AgentTesla, LimeRAT, Ransomware and Redline Stealer.
