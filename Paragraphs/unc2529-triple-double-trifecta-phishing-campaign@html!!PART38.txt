Plugins initialization routine prototype The current backdoor's implementation provides support for up to 32 plugins with each of them mapped and initialized in the backdoor's process space.
Additional Notes
The first backdoor instance we observed back in December 2020 was a stable and well-written code, but it was clearly a work in progress.
For example, the early instance of the malware spawns a thread to secure delete the DOUBLEDROP dropper from disk which indicates that an earlier variant of this malware launched a copy of the dropper from the file system.
