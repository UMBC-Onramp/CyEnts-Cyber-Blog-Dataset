Stage III – Sending Collected Data to the Attacker via SMTP
This malware has a specific function used to generate and send an email that includes the stolen sensitive information using the created CDO.Message object.
Figure 4.1 shows a snippet of this function code (I only included the key code).
As you can see, it calls rtcCreateObject2() to create the CDO.Message object, which then sets the email’s From, To, Subject, TextBody, and AddAttachment fields.
