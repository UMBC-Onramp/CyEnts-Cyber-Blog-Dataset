NRRD
Nearly Raw Raster Data Searching open directories and FTP servers while using several search engines, we gathered thousands of images—some of them complete MRI scans, mostly in DICOM format.
One example: An open directory of images.
The DICOM format originated in the 1980s, before cybersecurity was a key component.
The standard format contains a detailed list of tags such as patient name, station name, hospital, etc.
All are included as metadata with the image.
Opening an image with a text editor presents the following screen:
An example of the DICOM file format.
The file begins with the prefix DICM, an indicator that we are dealing with a DICOM file.
  Other (now obscured) strings in this example include the hospital’s name, city, patient name, and more.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requires a secure medical imaging workflow, which includes the removal or anonymizing of metadata in DICOM files.
