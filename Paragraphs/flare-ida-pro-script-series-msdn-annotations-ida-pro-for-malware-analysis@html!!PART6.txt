For every function reference in the import table, the plug-in annotates the function’s description and return value, adds argument descriptions, and renames constants.
An example of an annotated import table is depicted in Figure 2.
It shows how a descriptive comment is added to each API function call.
In order to identify addresses of instructions that position arguments prior to a function call, the plug-in relies on IDA Pro’s markup.
Figure 2:
Annotated import table Figure 3 shows the additional .msdn segment the plug-in creates in order to store argument descriptions.
This only impacts the IDA database file and does not modify the original binary.

The additional segment added to the IDA database
The .msdn segment stores the argument descriptions as shown in Figure 4.
The unique argument names and their descriptive comments are sequentially added to the segment.
