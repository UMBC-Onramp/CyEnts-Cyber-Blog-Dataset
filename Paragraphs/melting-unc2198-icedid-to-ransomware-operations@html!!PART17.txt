In addition, thank you to Mandiant frontline responders for harvesting the valuable intrusion data that enables our research.
Appendix:
Malware Families PHOTOLOADER is a downloader that has been observed to download ICEDID.
It makes an HTTP request for a fake image file, which is RC4 decrypted to provide the final payload.
Host information is sent to the command and control (C2) via HTTP cookies.
Samples have been observed to contain an embedded C2 configuration that contain the real C2 with a number of non-malicious domains.
The non-malicious domains are contacted in addition to the real C2.
WINDARC is a backdoor that hijacks the execution of TeamViewer to perform C2 communication.
It supports plugins and accepts several backdoor commands.
The commands include interacting with the TeamViewer tool, starting a reverse shell, loading new plugins, downloading and executing files, and modifying configuration settings.
