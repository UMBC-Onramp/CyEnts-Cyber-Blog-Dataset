In our PoC TIFF file, the BPS value is 0x09—which is not supported by UnpackLine —and the control flow never reaches a code path that writes to the buffer.
This is the root cause of the uninitialized memory, which gets processed further down the pipeline and finally shown as pixel data.
Patch After presenting my analysis to Microsoft, they decided to patch the vulnerability by making the files with unsupported BPS values as invalid.
This avoids all decoding and rejects the file in the very early phase of its loading.
