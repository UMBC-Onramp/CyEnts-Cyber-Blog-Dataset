The Sightings Report is based on a research project run by MITRE Engenuity’s Center for Threat-Informed Defense (Center) in collaboration with Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs and several other Center participants.
The researchers analyzed more than one million attacks using the MITRE ATT&CK® framework , collected over 28 months (April 1, 2019, to July 31, 2021), to provide contextual, actionable threat intelligence to explain how attackers are conducting their nasty business.
This threat intelligence report provides crucial visibility into which TTPs are being used the most by cyber adversaries.
Its “high resolution” visibility helps security professionals identify those threats they are most likely to face.
This enables them to quickly prioritize and fine-tune their defenses, including what security technologies to deploy and where.
The research from the Sightings Report paints “a picture of common adversary behavior, including which techniques adversaries use, how their use changes over time, and how adversaries sequence techniques.
