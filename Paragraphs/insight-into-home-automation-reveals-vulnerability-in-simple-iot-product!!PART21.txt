How much room is available on the stack, and are there any “bad” bytes that cannot make it onto the stack?
To determine the available room, we can examine how much of the payload makes it onto the stack if we repair the address overwritten on the stack with a valid address.
We learned only 91 bytes can be written onto the stack.
The next step is to determine if there are any “bad” bytes.
