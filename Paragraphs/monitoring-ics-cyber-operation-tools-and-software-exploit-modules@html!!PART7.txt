The most popular frameworks include Metasploit , Core Impact , and Immunity Canvas .
Also, since 2017, we have identified the development of younger ICS-specific exploit frameworks such as Autosploit , Industrial Exploitation Framework (ICSSPLOIT), and the Industrial Security Exploitation Framework .
Given the simplicity and accessibility of exploit modules, they are attractive to actors with a variety of skill levels.
Even less sophisticated actors may take advantage of an exploit module without completely understanding how a vulnerability works or knowing each of the commands required to exploit it.
We note that, although most of the exploit modules we track were likely developed for research and penetration testing, they could also be utilized throughout the attack lifecycle.
Exploit Modules Statistics Since 2010, Mandiant Intelligence has tracked exploit modules for the three major exploitation frameworks: Metasploit , Core Impact , and Immunity Canvas .
We currently track hundreds of ICS-specific exploit modules related to more than 500 total vulnerabilities, 71 percent of them being potential zero-days.
The break down is depicted in Figure 3.
Immunity Canvas currently has the most exploits due in large part to the efforts of Russian security research firm GLEG .
Figure 3: ICS exploit modules by framework Metasploit framework exploit modules deserve particular attention.
Even though it has the fewest number of modules, Metasploit is freely available and broadly used for IT penetration testing, while Core Impact and Immunity Canvas are both commercial tools.
