This coupled with the timing of operations – which coincides with Iranian working hours – and the use of multiple Iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our assessment that APT33 may have operated on behalf of the Iranian government.
The times of day that APT33 threat actors were active suggests that they were operating in a time zone close to 04:30 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
The time of the observed attacker activity coincides with Iran’s Daylight Time , which is +0430 UTC.
APT33 largely operated on days that correspond to Iran’s workweek, Saturday to Wednesday.
This is evident by the lack of attacker activity on Thursday, as shown in Figure 6.
Public sources report that Iran works a Saturday to Wednesday or Saturday to Thursday work week, with government offices closed on Thursday and some private businesses operating on a half day schedule on Thursday.
