De-obfuscated and sanitized bootstrap code Note that the actual values for <base64_encoded_path_to_launcher> , <launcher_reg_val> , and <xor_val> are generated on the fly by the dropper and will be different across the compromised systems.
The encoding of the launcher is implemented as a simple rolling XOR that is incremented after each iteration.
The following code snippet (Figure 8) could be used to either encode or decode the launcher, given the initial key.
