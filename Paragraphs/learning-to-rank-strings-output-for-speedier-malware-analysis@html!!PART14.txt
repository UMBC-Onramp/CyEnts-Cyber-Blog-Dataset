NDCG@ k scores are bounded between 0 and 1, with scores closer to 1 indicating better prediction quality in which more relevant strings surface towards the top.
This measurement allows us to evaluate the predictions from a given model versus those generated by other models and ranked with different algorithms.
To quantitatively assess model performance, we run the strings from each sample that have ground truth FLARE reports though the predict() step of Figure 2, and compare their predicted ranks with a baseline of the original ranking of strings output by Strings .
The divergence in distributions of NDCG@100 scores between these two approaches demonstrates that the trained GBDT model learns a useful structure that generalizes well to the independent holdout set (Figure 4).
Conclusion In this blog post, we introduced an ML model that learns to rank strings based on their relevance for malware analysis.
Our results illustrate that it can rank Strings output based both on qualitative inspection (Figure 3) and quantitative evaluation of NDCG@ k (Figure 4).
