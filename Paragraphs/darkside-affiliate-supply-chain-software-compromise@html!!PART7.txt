On May 18, 2021, a user in the affected organization browsed to the Trojanized link and downloaded the ZIP.
Upon installing the software, a chain of downloads and scripts were executed, leading to SMOKEDHAM and later NGROK on the victimâ€™s computer.
Additional malware use such as BEACON, and lateral movement also occurred.
Mandiant believes the Trojanized software was available from May 18, 2021, through June 8, 2021.
Pivoting on the slightly modified, but benign, MSHTA.exe application in VirusTotal, Mandiant identified a second installer package with the MD5 hash, e9ed774517e129a170cdb856bd13e7e8 (SVStation_Win64-B1130.1.0.0.exe), from May 26, 2021, which also connects out the same URL as the Trojanized SmartPSS installer.
Supply Chain Intrusion Cycle Figure 1:
Intrusion cycle Phase 1:
Trojanized Installer Download Mandiant Consulting observed the Trojanized installer downloaded on a Windows workstation after the user visited a legitimate site that the victim organization had used before.
The downloaded file was extracted to C:\\Users\\[username]\\Downloads\\06212019-General-SMARTPSS-Win32-ChnEng-IS\\General_SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS_V2.002.0000007.0.R.181023\\SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS_V2.002.0000007.0.R.181023-General-v1.exe.
Mandiant confirmed the user intended to download, install, and use the SmartPSS software.
Figure 2 shows an image of the download page used for SmartPSS software.
Figure 2: SmartPSS download page Phase 2: Nullsoft Installer The installer executable is a Nullsoft installer that when executed wrote two files to C:\\ProgramData\\SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS.
We were able to extract the malicious installer script and files for analysis using 7-Zip.
The relevant section of this installer script is shown below in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Nullsoft installer script section The installer script created two files: SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS_V2.002.0000007.0.R.181023-General.exe (b540b8a341c20dced4bad4e568b4cbf9) and smartpss.exe (c180f493ce2e609c92f4a66de9f02ed6).
