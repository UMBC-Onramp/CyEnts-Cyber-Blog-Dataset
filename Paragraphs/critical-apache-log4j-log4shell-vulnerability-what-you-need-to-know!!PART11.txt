Should the connection be successful, the “malicious-server.host” under the attacker's control replies to the query by inserting a malicious Java class file location into the directory data.
The Java implementation on the target will then download the malicious Java class file and execute it.
How does the Denial of Service (DoS) exploit work - CVE-2021-45105?
This vulnerability is not considered part of Log4Shell.
This will be more complex to execute because an attacker would need to have knowledge and control over lookup commands (e.g., via the Thread Context Map).
  
The vulnerability is an infinite recursion so a successful exploit would result in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
To take advantage of this, the vulnerable (or malicious) application will need to use a Context Map Lookup with a custom pattern layout.
