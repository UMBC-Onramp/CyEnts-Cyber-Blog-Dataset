However, the purpose of the main service here is not to monitor running apps and provide phishing UIs to steal banking credentials.
Instead, SimpleLockerâ€™s main service component scans the device for victim files and calls the file encryption class to encrypt files and demand a ransom.
The major differences in the SimpleLocker code are shown in the red boxes: AesCrypt and FileEncryptor.
Other common classes include: Main , the launching activity of both samples.
SDCardServiceStarter , another receiver that monitors the status of MainService and restarts it when it dies.
Tor and OnionKit, third-party libraries for private communication.
TorSender , HttpSender and Utils , supporting classes to provide code for CnC communication and for collecting device information.

Code structure comparison between SimpleLocker and SlemBunk samples
Finally, we located another SimpleLocker sample (SHA256 304efc1f0b5b8c6c711c03a13d5d8b90755cec00cac1218a7a4a22b091ffb30b) from July 2014, about two months after the first SimpleLocker sample.
