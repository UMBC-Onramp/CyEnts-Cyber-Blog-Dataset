We leveraged this earlier with wget to copy gdbserver to the device.
An attacker could also call wget from system to download and execute any script.
We explored further for installed applications and found NetCat, which could allow an attacker to write a script to create a reverse shell.
An attacker could download a script using wget, and execute the script containing a NetCat command to create a reverse shell.
We tested and proved this is one simple, effective method, opening a reverse shell as root.
Attackers could choose many other methods to leverage this exploit and execute code.
The following video demonstrates this exploit working with a reverse shell.
To illustrate, the team wrote an attack scenario.
After the plug is compromised, it could use the built-in UPnP library to poke a hole in the network router.
This hole creates a backdoor channel for an attacker to connect remotely, unnoticed on the network.
In the following video, we used a remote shell to control a TCL smart TV connected to the network.
The Roku API implementation on the TV uses simple unencrypted HTTP GET/POST requests to issue commands and does not authenticate the machine sending these commands, making remote control trivial.
