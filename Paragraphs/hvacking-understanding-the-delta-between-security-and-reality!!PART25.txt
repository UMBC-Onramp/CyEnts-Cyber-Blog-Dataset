One common approach to this problem is to patch the binaries.
It is important when looking at patching a binary to ensure the patch you employ does not introduce any unintended side effects.
This generally means you want to make the smallest change possible.
In this case, the smallest meaningful change the team came up with was to modify the “subtract by 5” to a “subtract by 0.”
  
This would not change how the overall program functioned; however, every time the function was called to decrement the counter, the counter would simply never get smaller.
