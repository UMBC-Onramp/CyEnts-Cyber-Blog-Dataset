When scammers target gamers, they are typically pursuing gaming accounts.
Today, we’re discussing a different target: players’ gold.
As games go, the massively popular World of Warcraft sees scammers target players on a regular basis, one day threatening them with a ban for alleged cheating , the next seeming to offer virtual pets (but not really; it’s a scam, after all).
A user nicknamed Legitamasterr posted on Reddit in late May, describing an original scam used at the World of Warcraft Classic Auction House.
The player, who was trying to buy a stack of Chronoboon Displacers for 66 gold coins, instead had more than 11,000 gold coins deducted from his account.
He had become a victim of a malicious script in an add-on he had installed.
