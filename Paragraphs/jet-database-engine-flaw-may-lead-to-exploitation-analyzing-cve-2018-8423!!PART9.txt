After a few more instructions, we can observe the original crash instructions.
Edx points to the memory location.
Ecx contains a very large number from the file group1.
The program tries to access memory at location [edx+ecx*4+574h], which will cause the out-of-bounds write and the program crashes: What is happening with the data the program tries to write?
If we watch the instructions, we see that program tries to write the value of esi to [edx+ecx*4+574].
If we print esi or the previous value, we see that it contains the index name ParentIdName, which we saw in group1:
Ultimately, the program crashes while trying to process ParentIDName with a very large index number.
