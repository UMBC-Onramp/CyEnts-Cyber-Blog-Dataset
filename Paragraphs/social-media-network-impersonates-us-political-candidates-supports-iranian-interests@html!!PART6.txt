For example, one account in the network, @AlexRyanNY, created in 2010, had only two visible tweets prior to 2017, one of which, from 2011, was in Persian and of a personal nature.
Subsequently in 2017, @AlexRyanNY claimed in a tweet to be “an Iranian who supported Hillary” in a tweet directed at a Democratic political strategist.
This account, using the display name “Alex Ryan” and claiming to be a Newsday correspondent, appropriated the photograph of a genuine individual also with the first name of Alex.
We note that it is possible that the account was compromised from another individual or that it was merely repurposed by the same actor.
Additionally, while most of the accounts in the network had their interface languages set to English, we observed that one account had its interface language set to Persian.
Impersonation of U.S. Political Candidates Some Twitter accounts in the network impersonated Republican political candidates that ran for House of Representatives seats in the 2018 U.S. congressional midterms.
These accounts appropriated the candidates’ photographs and, in some cases, plagiarized tweets from the real individuals’ accounts.
