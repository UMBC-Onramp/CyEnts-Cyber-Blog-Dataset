Pro Tip: Be sure to account for log data spanning over changes in UTC offset due to regional events such as daylight savings or summer seasons.
For example, local time zone adjustments will need to change for logs in United States Eastern Time from Virginia, USA from +TIME(5,0,0) to +TIME(4,0,0) the first weekend in March every year and back from +TIME(4,0,0) to +TIME(5,0,0) the first weekend in November to account for daylight and standard shifts .
