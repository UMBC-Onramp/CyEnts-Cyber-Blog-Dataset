On February 11, FireEye identified a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-0322)
  being served up from the U.S. Veterans of Foreign Wars’ website (vfw[.]org).
We believe the attack is a strategic Web compromise targeting American military personnel amid a paralyzing snowstorm at the U.S. Capitol in the days leading up to the Presidents Day holiday weekend.
Based on infrastructure overlaps and tradecraft similarities, we believe the actors behind this campaign are associated with two previously identified campaigns ( Operation DeputyDog and Operation Ephemeral Hydra ).
This blog post examines the vulnerability and associated attacks, which we have dubbed “Operation SnowMan.\" Exploit/Delivery analysis After compromising the VFW website, the attackers added an iframe into the beginning of the website’s HTML code that loads the attacker’s page in the background.
The attacker’s HTML/JavaScript page runs a Flash object, which orchestrates the remainder of the exploit.
The exploit includes calling back to the IE 10 vulnerability trigger, which is embedded in the JavaScript.
