“C” is for cumulative, which refers to the cumulative gain or summed total of every string’s relevance.
“D” is for discounted, which divides each string’s predicted relevance by a monotonically increasing function like the logarithm of its ranked position, reflecting the goal of having the most relevant strings ranked towards the top of our predictions.
