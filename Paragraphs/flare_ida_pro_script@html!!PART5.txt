The third optional argument is\nexplained in the next example.
The return from getPushArgs() is a list of\nresult dictionaries.
Each dictionary contains numbered keys ranging\nfrom 1,2,..n where n is the number of stack arguments requested.
In\nthe sample code in Figure 2 we obtain the lpStartAddress values by retrieving the tuple with\nkey 3, since lpStartAddress is the third\nparameter to the function we analyzed.
The values in the tuple are\n( va, value) , where va is the effective address that argtracker observed the data value being passed as a parameter.
