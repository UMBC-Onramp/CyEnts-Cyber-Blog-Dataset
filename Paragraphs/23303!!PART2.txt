Having analyzed the situation, MikroTik experts found no new vulnerabilities in the company’s routers; however, old ones may still pose a threat.
Therefore, to ensure your router has not joined the Mēris botnet (or any other botnet, for that matter), you need to follow a few recommendations.
Why MikroTik devices are joining the botnet A few years ago, security research discovered a vulnerability in MikroTik routers : Winbox, a configuration tool for MikroTik routers through which many devices were compromised.
Although MikroTik fixed the vulnerability back in 2018, apparently not all users updated their routers.
Furthermore, even among those who did, not everyone followed the manufacturer’s additional password-change recommendations.
If a user didn’t change the password, then even updated firmware could let attackers log in to the router and start exploiting it again.
According to MikroTik , the routers that are now infected with Mēris are the same devices that were compromised back in 2018.
The company has published indicators of device compromise and issued recommendations.
How to tell if your MikroTik router is part of a botnet When a router joins a botnet, cybercriminals change a number of settings in the device firmware.
